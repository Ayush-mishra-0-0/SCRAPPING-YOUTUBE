# SCRAPPING-YOUTUBE

## BY- AYUSH KUMAR MISHRA

Hello folks! I am currently learning Selenium and its application in scraping data from different sites. In this repository, I have attempted to use Selenium for scraping YouTube comments.

### REQUIREMENTS

- Python (version 3.6 or above).
- Install the Selenium library:
  - Using conda (if you have Anaconda):
    ```
    conda install selenium
    ```
  - OR using pip:
    ```
    pip install selenium
    ```
- Ensure the presence of the `urllib3` library. If not installed by default, you can use pip:
  If you are using Anaconda, use the following command:
  ```
  conda install -c anaconda urllib3
  ```



In the future, I may add some automation codes to this repository too.

# THANK YOU
