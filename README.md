# SCRAPPING-YOUTUBE

# BY- AYUSH KUMAR MISHRA
Hello folks!! I was currently learning selenium and its application in scapping data from differnt sites.
So here i have tried to use it for scrapping utube comments.

REQUIREMENTS-

a) Python(version above 3.6).

b) Install selenium library -
   i) either using conda install selenium(if u have anaconda).
   ii) OR type pip install selenium in cmd.
   
c) Many time urllib is not present by default, so u might have to install it too (pip install urllib)
    or if u are using anaconda you have to use this command- conda install -c anaconda urllib3

In future i may add some automation codes in this repo too.
