      "{'Comments': {0: '@vatimati-kq4dh - I can’t believe Peter went into so much detail about his mental health issues, he was so vulnerable and had incredible humility to share what he did. Masculine men who have success in all aspects of their life usually would never share this. What a beautiful, beautiful episode. Especially towards the end regarding emotional health.\\n@justinthomascoaching - One of my favorite podcast interviews of all-time. Informative and authentic. Thank you Dr. Huberman for giving us this gift and of course for Dr Attia and the work that he has done not only with the countless hours of research and care for his patients that benefits us all, but the work he has done on himself as an example of positive change is doable. Thanks again!!\\n@lola.t.6399 - This is the most spellbinding of all the interviews Dr. Huberman did. Admittedly, sometimes the acronyms etc are over my head. NOT THIS TIME.  I was hooked for over three hours. Every segment was useful. I’ve forwarded this to everyone I know. Thank God for you both. \\n@joliegray1572 - My father died of atherosclerotic cardiovascular and atherosclerotic cerebral disease last year. This video gave me understanding and closure I’ve desperately craved since his passing. Your video dedicated to grief helped me as well. I’m eternally grateful to you and Dr. Attia for helping me wade through the murkiest waters I’ve encountered. Thank you for your dedication to science.\\n@sofiaaa5561 - In addition to your generosity in sharing otherwise unattainable top tier medical information I would like thank you for your social intelligence! To observe two accomplished men genuinely complementing one another, celebrating each others success  in  such organic way is heartwarming. Bravo you two!\\n@squareback7457 - Wow. The discussion on emotional health has already changed my life It moved me to tears as I was driving to work. It made me say to myself, “Do something before you lose everything that matters to you.” Thank you, Peter and Andrew.”\\n@VictorSneller - Wow, that was some deep emotional maturity. I appreciate Dr. Attia walking through how to heal yourself emotionally.\\n@mirjamstein3834 - What an amazing episode. Loved it! As a trainer in ensa Mental Health First Aid am in particular impressed about the last 45 minutes about emotional health. This from two giants like you are in your businesses, made my day! More of such role models are highly in need. Thank you!\\n@HeidiAbbottTravel - Wow. Andrew your interviewing skills, calm voice and vulnerable curiosity make all your podcasts enjoyable. This podcast may be my favorite. Dr Attia’s deep dive into several subjects regarding health span and especially the emotional health side of that has totally shifted the way I look at disease and health. Andrew, you truly are bringing science to the masses in an easily digestible and actionable way. Thank you. My life is better for it.\\n@christineg3905 - Unbelievable discussion towards the end where Peter told his story about rehab and recovery from emotional trauma. Working his way out of negative self talk and recovery isn’t easy and I commend him for that - thank you for sharing!!\\n@donnapalmer2099 - It took me four days to get thru this podcast (part time) but man am I\\'m glad I got to the end because you two really gave us a blockbuster ending with so much emotion and love! I can\\'t tell you how great this podcast was and will be for so many!! It\\'s a must listen for anyone who gives a damn for their physical and emotional health! I\\'ll be listening to this podcast  over and over because all of your thoughts and words were powerful gems for the brain, soul and body! Thank you gentlemen for such great insight! Can\\'t wait to hear your next show!\\n@MrSarollia - for me this has to be the most valuable 3.3 hrs on YouTube ever. Thank you Andrew and Peter.\\n@briansoares7489 - I have been very educated and astounded at the amount of work that you, Andrew(I feel like I know you), have put into this incredible, continuous mass of information that you give to us. Thank you very much. This latest pod cast with Peter Atia was mind blowing, and is willingness to be vulnerable will forever impact my life. Beautiful!\\n@user-zb1fy7si2v - This is by far the best podcast I’ve seen with the most inspiring experts in the medical field today! Thank you to both for doing it!\\n@jeremyfinn9312 - I\\'ve been listening to this episode for three days during my commute to and from work. Today was mostly the mental health portion at the end. Hearing Dr. Attia share his experience with his \\'Bobby Knight\\' voice echoed much of my life. Hearing him share about all the things he was incredibly vulnerable about on this episode did something to/for me. I started a journey similar to his about a year ago when I had a relationship that meant very much to me end. I started working on an idea I have for a book around this topic, and I cried like I\\'ve been trying to do for almost a year. I\\'m finally starting to be able to grieve some of the things I feel like I lost in my life, or be able to go far deeper in my healing. I\\'ve listened to many episodes of your sharing and I love all of them, but this one especially has been a catalyst. Thank you so much. I pray I can help our world as much as you and your colleagues have. Thank you so much.\\n@renniev9006 - Every Monday, this podcast continually raises the bar.  Extraordinary content, and I thank you both!  And to Dr Huberman, you have completely changed my relationship to light.  It honestly used to bother me how incessantly you speak of it, but because of your dedication to the subject I now feel light to be a fuel, and I have become more aware of it, it\\'s presence, it\\'s intensity, and the way it can fill a space, from a closet to forest.  Thank you!\\n@jawadkhanniazi2802 - I have been following both these gentlemen for a while now but this conversation is just so amazing and actionable. I recently got my labs done and its not a pretty picture. But, I have a very clear picture of which markers I need to watch for and how to think about improving them. Thank you Dr. Huberman and Dr. Attia.\\n@CuriosityIgnited - This podcast was amazing! Dr. Attia is so knowledgeable and generous with his insights on health span, longevity and emotional health. I learned so much from his book and this interview. He really breaks down the science and art of living well and avoiding the major causes of death. I especially liked his honesty about his own struggles and how he overcame them. Thank you Huberman Lab for bringing him on the show! \\n - I\\'m 7 weeks in on my very first nutritional health journey. Listening two to three hours of Huberman everyday is filling my head with information and enthusiasm for my time restricted eating and low carbs. At 54 I have never felt better. This is crazy and I can\\'t believe this isn\\'t widely known. Thank you\\n@adrianbara5405 - First, I would like to thank you Andrew for all your work and for the benefits I have from it. I am following and listening to your podcasts for a while, but this particular episode made me address few words. For me is a special, very useful one, which I will recommend to all my dear ones. And the last part, especially the openness  Peter had to share his own experience , was the cherry on the cake. \\n@davidrieger4397 - Thank You Peter & Andrew! I am 85 next week & going through adjustment to my final reality. Your authenticity and scientific information is extremely helpful. Thank You!\\nDave Rieger\\n@bunandreea3056 - Hello! I am a medical student from Romania and all I can say is that I am dreaming of having professors like you and Peter! So much gratitude for everything you do !!!\\n@victoryshieldtacticalllc3534 - This is the most invested I\\'ve been in one of your podcasts yet. Having almost died in Iraq in a vehicle incident and also having cancer, the prospect of dying earlier than average has been looming. I have some kids that I really want to be there for into their adulthood, so I appreciate all of the tips and advice that this episode provided. Thanks, to you both!\\n@Wilomite - Two of my absolute favorite doctors. Thank you both for the positive impact you\\'ve made in my life.\\n@emilybarry9410 - Wow! I am so impressed and grateful for Peter’s vulnerability in this conversation. I completely to relate to his struggles with future-tripping, perfection, and mental health in general and I feel an even stronger connection to him for sharing his struggles. I can wait to read Outline and also to delisted to this fantastic and helpful conversation. Thank you  Andrew and Peter \\n@Miss_Annlaug - I am so inspired.  Because of this podcast and others like it im heading back to school this fall. I have become increasingly passionate about medicine and sience in the past years with a special live for preventative medicine and nutrition.  I start my course to become a certified medical secretary this autumn. in the meantime im taking advantage of some very low cost classes at Harvard!\\n@user-xl4ck2yp3i - What an amazing collaboration!  Appreciate the vulnerability and candor from 2 of my favorite podcasters and health gurus. Thank you so much for making us better!\\n@beabunny83 - If there was a podcast award for interview with the most practical information about health and longevity, this should win hands down.  Peter has a gift for explaining very complex ideas and concepts in an easy to understand way (most of time :)) and Andrew ask the questions and follow up questions that everyone wants to know.\\n@nybergjm - I have so much admiration for Peter, particularly for someone who can be so open and vulnerable about these challenges - despite the fact that emotional vulnerability is exactly the thing that is so difficult for him. I hope to make the kind of self-growth that he clearly has. As a quick side-note and suggestion for a future podcast, I would love a video (or perhaps a series?) on strategies for new parents to enhance their ability to adapt to the challenges of early infant care (e.g., frequent night awakenings; chronic sleep deficits) and ways to quickly promote \"homeostasis\" in the home environment again (e.g., helping the infant sleep through the night as early as possible). For example, I would love to know what the literature says about morning sunlight viewing with infants and the effects it has on the infant\\'s circadian rhythm. I know my infant daughter of 6 weeks typically won\\'t open her eyes when we go \"praise the sun\" in the morning together, and I wonder if that might be because her eyes are just too sensitive to the brightness. Give it some thought, as I\\'m sure it would be enormously helpful for many new and expecting parents out there (including myself). Thanks for the excellent episode, Andrew!\\n@deekana - The whole episode is extremely useful and informative. I like the latter part the most. Being a perfectionist, and a scientist with a past experiencing abusive childhood and toxic relationship, I can totally relate with what he has been through. It\\'s relieving to know that there are amazing, high-achieving and respectable people out there who have had similar struggles and are overcoming it. Thank you for your sincerity. I know it\\'s not easy to openly accept and discuss our weakness. I appreciate and respect it a lot!\\n@haydenmackenzie918 - Remarkably, the quality of both Andrew and Peter\\'s content far exceeds the expensive university education I get locally. I can\\'t thank you enough for making this freely accessible.\\n@pulsechaintrainer780 - Awesome podcast, awesome guest, awesome host. Life changing book! Thank you Andrew and Peter for bringing true wellness to the forefront and teaching us to look for health indicators rather than the sick symptoms that most MD’s are scared to get away from.  You both are true pioneers in the next wave of health, wellness and longevity.\\n@RisingSunHolisticHealth - Talk about presence. That last half hour, I was completely engrossed. Thank you Peter Attia for being so vulnerable and for showing that there is a way forward from the past, but also showing your humanity. It\\'s easy to look at people like you, and Huberman, and assume you guys are perfect in every way, and feel a bit less than as a result. We are all masterpieces, but we are all works in progress. Best Ep x\\n@indigogyrl6094 - Thank you!  One of your best podcasts to date.  And Peter THANK YOU for sharing your personal emotional well being journey and also including it in your book.  Looking forward to reading it as well.  You both are contributing profoundly to our understanding of health and wellness!  LOVE IT \\n@janem3754 - Extremely glad I watched every second of this almost 3.5 hour episode.  It’s one of the most information-packed videos I’ve ever seen. Thanks to both of you for sharing your hearts and vast knowledge. \\n@CalixtoErico - This episode is such a gut punch. But one I needed and would not have allowed others to deliver. And I would have probably allowed myself to shed a few tears if I had not been at work while listening to the rage section. Peter, Andrew, thank you.\\n - This lineup is crazy, getting ready to soak in the knowledge. Peter Attia is a key player in human longevity for our future\\n@amelioration8437 - Great episode. Thank you gentlemen \\nAnd yes .. Emotional health is a major component to our health\\nKeep up the great work!\\n@dawnintucson - Epic video. Literally one of the best videos I’ve ever watched. Thank you both. It’s so unfortunate that the local doctors in the broken health care system had this info. Maybe they do, but their hands are tied.\\n@aaronl528 - Can\\'t wait to get Peter\\'s book!  My two favorite podcasters on the same episode, you bet I\\'ll be listening to this one again.  As a 50 year old all these topics around health span, lifespan, and longevity are very important to me and I\\'ve put many of these into practice and it changed my life.\\n@darthom78 - Listened to this episode on Spotify. The last 40 mins of this brought me to tears because of how it relates to my life and current emotional state. Thanks for sharing. I have lots of work to do and this was very helpful. I do have Outlive and can\\'t wait to finish it\\n@foodmomcoe6477 - Peter’s discussion about the core of himself is so thoughtful of him to share with us. It’s quite meaningful. Another great Monday with a fabulous guest!!!\\n@deeksha_thakur - Peter\\'s journey is incredible. Covering major aspects of \"health\" in today\\'s world and not shying away from sharing his own emotional journey thereby being an inspiration for others. God bless him.\\nThanks to Andrew for bringing this to us.\\n@robertknight9242 - I feel like everyone remotely interested in their health needs to watch this. Thanks again for everything you both do to educate the world about these topics!\\n@janettekenos3674 - One of the best discussions I have heard in this health community! Thank you for all you do, both Andrew and Peter, I am a big fan. I am in the process of reading Peter’s book and my biggest dream would be  to find a doctor who thinks and practices the same way. Here’s to speeding up the practice  of Medicine 3.0!\\n@mashafastov - I just wanted to say thank you for creating such an incredible podcast. It\\'s not often that I come across something that truly captures my attention and makes me feel as though I\\'ve paused my entire life to listen, but that\\'s exactly how I felt while watching and listening to your latest episode. Your knowledge and expertise are simply mind-blowing, and I couldn\\'t help but take notes throughout the entire thing.\\n@SuperSantogold - Opening up more and more to episodes in Metabolic Health and Mitochondrial perspectives. Gratitude infinitely to both of you. Love you both \\n@user-fs3qg9sl5s - I absolutely loved this podcast and I am extremely grateful for the sharing of the incredible knowledge and self improvement tools in this episode. The section on emotional health touched me deeply. I cannot wait to read Dr Attia\\'s book (at least twice). Thank you!\\n@2xSundays - I thought what Peter shared about his rage was wonderful. As smart as Peter Attia is that is the most profound I’ve heard him. I feel like his tone during this interview was different than his tone in other interviews. Congrats on the success from the work you’ve put in!\\n@gradysimpson3137 - This was an absolutely incredible discussion. It\\'s going to change my entire life!! I immediately rushed to the book store to purchase \"Out Live\"  by Peter Attia. And scheduled a MRI body scan\\n@carmenradu5514 - Thank you both for such a deep and honest content! This is so, so! brave of you! \\nI sincerely hope that more and more people become aware of how important health is, both physical and mental. And  that they start nurturing it\\n@JTOFTHESEA - Excited for the move from pay-walled molecular markers to free emotional markers for health. We can all learn from a friend with a smile or a frown. Would love to see more on this and specifically emotionally healthier ways to tackle the working day.E.g the potential relationship between emotional dissonance in the work place and its effect on the dopamine-reward system and burn-out. After listening to lex fridman x shannon curry and then this I feel there\\'d be lot\\'s to talk about. Cheers!\\n@hendelar - Yeah. The emotional chapter was immensely important. Vulnerability, can resonate, is only effective with authenticity. Grateful to you both. Cheers.\\n@cathy3701 - I watched this twice not only to absorb the science but to listen to Peter\\'s heartfelt and very moving discussion of his recovery from emotional trauma.  I have followed him for several years and I am deeply moved by his honesty and willingness to explore and resolve his trauma.  This is a beautiful example of a very intelligent man accessing his heart and healing himself.\\n@stakingaclaim - I have so enjoyed Dr. Attia\\'s talks on this podcast. His discussion of how we swim in our own poor self-talk  and how it begins to spill over into interactions with other people (perhaps because we imagine others are saying those same things) was so relatable.\\n@suezm5357 - Thoroughly enjoyed this chat from two of my favourite guys. Thank you!  I have Outlive on Audible and have just bought paperback to read.   I appreciate all of the amazing and free info \\n@eriqcournand1928 - One of the most important episodes in my opinion, I’m glad to be educated on this topic at a young age knowing my family history.\\n@nathalierodrigues6271 - I am speechless!! Absolutely amazing!! I have no words to express my gratitude for both of you in sharing these amount of incredible information! Thank you\\n@lindaelarde2692 - I get graduate level instruction from every episode of Huberman Lab. The vulnerability of Dr. Attia\\'s sharing  emotional rehab and continuing effort to gain self awareness allows all of us listening to self reflect and evaluate what we may need to  do to be better at self compassion and relationships.  Thank you.\\n@iwayfitness - This was the first time I was truly surprised from the content in a Huberman Lab episode! I regularly my listen to these with my Monday exercise and continue throughout the week. I did not see the ending going in that direction. This will get plenty of people to think (if even briefly) about emotional health and ideally improve it, and with that their overall quality of life!\\n@NovoAXginger - 3:24:45 I absolutely love this episode and dialogue between you both. Highly respect both of your work. Preordered your book Dr Attia!\\n@MrZkoki - The work and effort you put in is unbelievable. You are prepared on all levels. Thank you for your service. Everyone watching this video is definitely helped, informed and grateful.\\n@alexandrel.c.4796 - This podcast was a game changer for me! Thank you both! \\n@aniagarner2273 - What a fantastic episodethe part about emotional health was incredible - thank you so much for sharing your story. Cannot wait for my book to arrive to Polandall the best!\\n@GabbiMyers97 - Thank you Peter, and Andrew for delivering information that is so important and helpful for so many people. Going to be reading peters book very soon, and just wanted to seriously say how grateful I am that you guys take time to do these podcasts. I learn so much from you guys, and it has truly inspired me to research and just truly live a better life. Thank you, and thank you again.\\n@gazels11 - Thank you again and again for this podcast. Thanks to all your guests as well. You are changing lives with each episode.\\n@mlouw8218 - I ended up skipping ahead to the emotional part (because that’s also my worst problem) and I feel so grateful for the openness. I resonate a lot with much of what Peter describes \\n@nataliegil2643 - Two of the most down-to-earth, humble and yet brilliant minds of our generation! Thank you so much for all you do. Both \\n@Angie_cheeks - Beautifully done. Great podcast and astounding conclusion. My biggest admiration to the both of you.\\n@brittanybadinger6610 - Easily one of the best collabs I’ve seen! Thank you both so much for sharing so much wisdom!\\n@terrygivens132 - Amazing podcast, I’ve been waiting for Dr. Attia’s book to come out. Thanks to him for sharing his emotional experiences. Emotional health is vital to physical health.\\n@sarahbarnwell5296 - Wow, this should be on repeat at every primary care clinic across the nation. Thank you for this content!\\n@DKFX1 - Really loved the anecdote Attia shared about negative self-talk. Given his openness about it I think he\\'s probably well recovered from that aspect of his personality which truly sounded horrific and toxic. I also experience negative self-talk quite often but it\\'s not centered around anger about myself and people around me. Mine is more centered around anger and concern of wicked aspects of society and anger at the world conditions.\\n@CalixtoErico - This is the second time I listen to the episode start to finish. I feel as if I was slacking with my habbits and needed something to help me get back in gear, and this is it. Once again, Peter was a phenomenal guest and Andrew did an exceptional job conducting the episode. Thank you both.\\n@sherrihodges849 - I can\\'t express how much appreciation I have for both of these men! I look forward to reading the book!\\n@oranjetractor - You guys…!!!! I love your work both individually and together. This episode was truly a gem.\\n@m.jorg.5361 - Thank you so much for your work Andrew!  That was one of your best podcasts and I am glad I discovered Peter and now I can follow his podcasts as well. I\\'ve already read so many books thanks to your podcasts and looking forward to reading this one too. As for new topics, I would so much like you to make a podcast about p-dtr therapy (Proprioceptive Deep Tendon Reflex). I am currently undergoing this therapy myself and I see a lot of improvement but I still don\\'t understand what this therapy is all about \\n@etielahat9414 - This was to me more about friendship and being a man in our exponentially changing world, than anything else. Andrew, Peter, thank you for that. Watching till the end was so worth it. The knowledge shared was amazing but even more was the bond and courageous honesty.\\n@annemurphy8248 - Love this amazing podcast. This episode in particular is chock full of relevant, informative advice that is needed to enhance and improve card from my mainstream medical health care providers. Main stream medicine doesn’t tell us everything we need to know. We need you Andrew and Peter! I was especially impressed with Peter’s honest and brave description of his struggles with anger and emotional health. Many of us struggle with these issues- mine are related to perfectionism as well. Can’t wait to read the book.\\n@kenmayeaux5574 - Amazing courage and vulnerability for Peter to share regarding his recovery. And so hopeful for all who struggle emotionally, despite appearing \"successful\" in worldly terms.  Me too..... Most emotionally compelling interview I\\'ve ever heard on the show.  Thanks to you both!\\n@alfarac - Preordered his book, it has been so long since I have been engaged to a long podcast like this one. Super inciteful and helpful. Thanks so much for this!\\n@susiebernsten7022 - Thank you both!  So encouraged by Peter’s emotional health journey!  Lifesaving information at so many  levels.  God Bless!\\n@stephaniemable - Just so touched by the conversation towards the end of this. Thank you both for having such an open and vulnerable conversation about mental health. It\\'s so important for men to have public conversations that include talking about their emotional struggles (and their therapists!) Unfortunately, this\\'s still too rare. I\\'m sure this conversation will help open doors for some of your listeners and maybe make their own reaching for help more likely.\\n@JC-lg4fz - I’m awed by Dr Peter Attila’s humility and willingness to share his personal experiences to educate the public.  So many AHA moments for me to implement in my life, that can improve the quality of my life and relationships!  As always thanks to Dr Andrew Huberman for his passion in improving people’s quality of life, free of cost! I take a deep bow, gentlemen!\\n@ftakenouchi1464 - Thank you for this Andrew, another amazing podcast with one of my fav health experts Peter A.  You are inspiring millions, pls keep doing what you are doing. \\n@aliciaabbott5797 - This podcast was very intriguing and totally captivated my attention. It was so easy to follow Dr. Peter Attia in his medical knowledge and then endind with him opening up about his very personal problem.  A very refreshing and inspiring podcast.\\n@monique7746 - I learned so much and found the end of the podcast very moving.  Thank you for sharing Peter.  This resonates and I appreciate you so much.  And thank you for holding the space Andrew, you\\'re a wonderful human being.  Love you both\\n@tylercobb8671 - I’ve listened to nearly every huberman podcast and I look forward to them every Monday morning so I can listen to it while doing my weekly sauna protocol! But this episode has to be the best yet, absolutely so informative while clear, concise and easily digestible and applicable knowledge. Truly thank you Dr. Huberman and Dr. Peter Attia\\n@MrTMS71972 - Wow.  Blown away.  Thank you both - to Andrew for hosting this podcast and Andrew for being so open with the audience.  A whole new level of respect for both of you.\\n@jkuhl1343 - Thank you Andrew and Peter - amazing podcast.  Such impactful and actionable information.  Huberman Lab continues to be my favorite podcast! Now on to buying Peter\\'s book!\\n@77777jetta - Andrew, you and Peter are my favorite Doctors/ Scientist ! Thank you so much for having Dr. Attia on your podcast! It is so cool to watch you guys do the Tango talk about longgivity! Andrew  you must have Peter on your show again! Listening to you both, is like jumping into sea of knowledge! I just can\\'t get enough! You two, young men keep up the great work! Thank you for sharing your knowledge! Simply Awesome!\\n@inessashlifer8026 - As always, thank you so much. You are doing an amazing job to educate all your listeners. I am grateful to know you, sincerely, Inessa.\\n@simpleman7203 - Simply wow. I\\'m little bit out of words here, that is incredible conversation. Absolutely the best episode of Andrew\\'s podcast. Great information and insights, some life wisdom at the end and so sincere yet quite stoic contemplation on own life, on own growth. I\\'m in awe. Loved every single minute, of the video and now I must buy Peter\\'s book. \\n@maryanndull3446 - Gentlemen, I can\\'t Thank You both enough for the work you are doing, and the priceless health information that you are giving to anyone who bothers to listen.  Every moment of this particular discussion has great value and I appreciate the time, energy, and intensity put into it.  I really respect Peter\\'s self disclosure on his personal mental health journey.  It certainly resonated with me and things that I still struggle even though I worked as a Therapist for several years.  As a Woman, there is nothing I like more than a Man who is very candid, genuine, and present \"in the moment\".  Both of you Gentlemen are stellar examples of just that.  Your affection for each other as colleagues and friends was extremely heartfelt and a great ending to this broadcast.\\n@DebiDalio - Thank you both so much for the invaluable knowledge you provide to all of us. I appreciate having as much information as possible when I am making decisions about my health. (Plus I\\'ve always had an interest in biology, so I geek out when you go into details.)\\n@skategenie - The fact that we can access this valuable information for free is a testament to the coupling of modern technological advances and brilliant minds. Thank you Drs. Huberman and Attia for this work! What a day to be alive.\\n@w.w.w.w.w - My two favourite! Took me the whole Monday to finish listening to this, but I can honestly say it\\'s the most fruitful Monday listening such valuable discussion. I especially appreciate the last part when Dr. Attia shared his personal experience, how a man so brilliant and tough-looking can share his vulnerable journey. Looking forward to the book. Is there an audiobook with his own voice ??\\n@trevorschneider248 - Life changing info! Thank you both for sharing! Everyday of my life will be different after listening 210 minutes! Well worth it!\\n@Crudo169 - This is one of the most intelligent and important podcast conversations I\\'ve ever heard. The health-span and screening health-tips knowledge is essential, but when this conversation launched into the emotional-health and therapy section it really took me by surprise. \\nI was in IFS (internal family systems) therapy for over six-years, and Dr Attia\\'s description of his therapy experience and process and tools, all sounds very familiar.\\n@robertvali8426 - I\\'ve listened to this one a few times and recommend it to all my friends .\\nWords beyond prescription.\\n@EmptyNestWanderingFeet - I listen/watch both of your channels and have learnt an awful lot from you both and I try to implement a lot of what you suggest: so a big thank you to you.  Especially now in my late 50s I see around me the direction my peers are moving towards and I want a different older age to the one they are accepting.  One thing that struck me from this latest episode is the courage you both shown in facing your personal emotional demons and your willingness to look into the root for these manifestations.  I would like to do the same but not sure I have the inner strength to try it but certainly listening to you has given me food for thoughts.  I was also surprised when I heard that you both see a therapist on a regular basis.  As a child growing up in the 70s and 80s Britain, therapies/counseling always elicit a sense of self-indulgence which only Americans embrace. Maybe I need to rethink that too.  I do however feel we are very blessed to have the opportunity to consider all these new life sciences and the freedom to pick and choose which ones to incorporate in our lives.\\n@danielarmitage6576 - Another great informative interview and by far for me personally the segment starting at 3:16:34 could be life altering.  Like Dr. Attia, I\\'m not sure when or why my anger started but it trails back as far as I can remember.   My negative self talk is definitely something I need to get undercontrol not only for myself by those around me.  Thanks again for doing these and looking forward to reading Dr. Attia\\'s book for more insight on this.\\n@debrawaites4085 - I waited for emotional health all the way through.  Thank you for opening yourself up to\\nVulnerability.  You are giving hope and saving lives  it meant the world to me\\n@user-dungsil - This is a very intense (infomation-wise and emotion-wise) conversation which doesn\\'t become overwhelming or emotional in a disrupting way. The knowledge they share in the video is invaluable to ordinary people like me. I\\'m so thankful to these two doctors. I feel how they talk and listen to each other respectfully as friends is something I would remember and want to do likewise most of all.\\n@julielipkin - I am a Clinical Psychologist (and actually also a fitness instructor) and I listened to this podcast and also to you on Attia’s podcast. I am so impressed with how both of you have used therapy in your lives. I have not practiced therapy for awhile because I think the current system is a mess. Please have a podcast addressing this and also trying to help people understand how therapy should be able to help them if the system worked better. Relationships are healing. Tools learned in therapy are healing. It isn’t perfect and it is a process. When I started graduate school in the 1980’s, most insurance paid 50% for unlimited sessions. Financial barriers now exist but so do barriers of resistance and shame. If more people understood and if somehow therapy was recognized as important to health and wellness and part of disease prevention ….maybe I can regain my faith in the system and even come back to help.\\n@sarajones8093 - This has been one of the most amazing and important videos on health I’ve ever listened too!  It really has me motivated to work harder on my mental and physical well-being.  Greatly enjoyed the emotional chapter with Peter’s testimony.  You guys are great. Thank you for sharing.\\nSara\\n@CREATED4HISGLORY - I just finished Peter’s book , which I highly recommend!  This episode was wonderful.  Thank you to both of you!\\n@micacherimoya2498 - Finding your podcasts has been a massive blessing Andrew. I found you via the alcohol episode, have not had a single drink since i watched this lol simply lost interest by being told the information I clearly needed to hear. I now incorporated your podcasts into my teen son`s homeschooling also. He loves them. Massive thank you for the work you do.\\n@yvonnekiwior9633 - Andrew, as a grateful granny I adore you! And immensely appreciate listening to you and another favorite brilliant human Peter Attia, I look forward to his book.\\nI agree his last chapter will be a huge asset for us all.\\n@LasheXX - Thank you for this podcast and your work Dr. Peter Attia and Prof. Andrew!\\n@debbicompel-mavericklife4330 - I look forward to every time you two are together. Always meaningful and thought provoking conversation   .\\n@sob6911 - Impeccable timing  recently diagnosed at 43, I’ve tried elvanse (uk version of vyvanse) for 3 months got to a high dose and these didn’t work for me, so today I’m starting concerta and your information answered all the questions I needed answered.\\nThank you ️\\n@drbethtx - This conversation is so impressive at many levels! I’ve now ordered Peter’s book. I soo appreciate both of these brilliant scientists, their insights, their authenticity, their generosity and most of all their willingness to be vulnerable. They are incredible role models. Thank you so much for improving all our lives!\\n@user-rj8bg4sh7p - Hi, I  just finished listening to Dr. Attia over the course of a couple sessions. I have never been moved as much by the depth of knowledge , insight and wisdom presented in a podcast or anywhere for that matter. I am a 74 year old guy (retired dentist) and could not wait to pass along the link to those who mean the most to me . The last session on emotional health brought tears to my eyes; after cleaning up the tears I ordered the book. Thank you Andrew and Peter, Eric Ranta\\n@allanae - Finally, yes! Peter is my favorite guest and I\\'ve been so stoked waiting for this to come out. Thank you both!\\n@user-tm5pn6bv3u - From the first episode on I\\'m enjoying your work a lot :-) I learned a lot from you. Thanks for all the information and knowledge you provide for us. Something I would love to hear is a conversation between you and Dr. Eric Cobb from Z-Health. In general I would enjoy you talking about neuroathletics. I\\'m sure you can provide some useful information on this field and maybe some practical advice for the  average athlete.\\n@cloverfarr6133 - Thank you for a great contribution to our health and bringing  this info to the general public\\n@ekachogovadze7020 - It was soooo interesting podcast! Thank you Andrew and special thanks to Peter for mentioning amazingly informative and so valuable personal experience about emotional health! Thank you <3 I LOVE your podcasts <3\\n@nadinebenueza1439 - This is easily one of my top 3 episodes of yours. Thank you so so much for this\\n@ddh8340 - Listening to Dr Andrew & Dr Peter talk about the language around emotional health(while walking east towards the rising son) I fantasized about a discussion between Dr. Andrew and Brene Brown where they explored the neuro-biology of shame and other emotions. Thank you Andrew for bringing us the science. I\\'m off to order 2 more books...\\n@rinadror - Thank you for your weekly persistence in uploading the podcast topics in the field of health.  As someone who listens to you regularly every week for almost a year, I must admit that you have changed my lifestyle for the better.  I learned from you about the health of the body and mind which improved my health. Thanks again and looking forward to the podcast next week.\\n@shannonsampson3267 - Life changing information. Thank you, Peter and Andrew.\\n@MKstudiovideo - I wish this video never ends. So good, so full of new important info to me.\\n@user-ft6un9br3y - One of the very best yet, Dr. Huberman!  Loved all of it and I plan on listening to it several times so that I can absorb all of the information offered.  If I may make one request...when will you do a series on the largest organ in the human body?  If you can help me improve my skin the way you\\'ve helped my sleep, exercise, hormones and general well-being I will be in great shape!\\n@nickcheeawai9661 - I have listened to a number of your talks on youtube and this one just was so life changing...  this is one that is so packed with good information  -- thanks for being a stand up person Dr H., so that you could foster such a friendship with another outstanding individual.  Peter is intense, and could probably benefit by regular yoga nidra sessions, but sometimes having purpose well defined can be a poison pill.  I just wish him the best...  its like that Olympic champion who has won his 15 or so gold medals and then he says, what\\'s next!\\n@barbarajacquemin6329 - Another excellent interview. Thank so so much to you two! Gracias desde Mexico!\\n@emilyzfrani4156 - Also would be highly interested in watching an ep where you speak about animals & our relationship to them; perhaps also  touching  on some research related to therapeutic-like benefits of regularly being around animals  &/or having them in the home! I have witnessed temperamental and psychological transformations of some loved ones from merely bringing a puppy into their home. Btw HUGE fan of yours-- cannot emphasis how much I love your content and mission, and appreciate all that you contribute to society! You are an absolute inspiration!\\n@sabinepersijn7905 - I love your podcast!! Can you do an episode on tinnitus & neuroplasticity? And maybe on social media/screen time and its effects on (mental) health? :)\\n@sethwolfe2058 - Andrew, I had epilepsy surgery due to intractable epilepsy in 2018 and your podcasts have help me relearn my new brain and make myself better. I sometimes find it hard to correlate things specifically to me as I’m missing my right temporal lobe, including hippocampus and amygdala. I’ve heard you talk about HM in one of your episodes. He had both sides taken out. Personally, I think it would be cool for you to hear you talk about people like me walking around with part of their brain missing and how we can cope with life like normal. Thank you for your great stuff and helping me grow. \\n@joshhoobler5769 - This episode was truly next level all thanks to the portions on emotional health. For me, this is the most inspiring, and perhaps the most valuable episode of the podcast thus far. Thank you to both you and Dr. Attia\\n@CynthiaBrattesani - Thank for the  in-depth exposure of this vital health information explained in  a meaningful way. Andrew  & Peter, the last minutes of your emotional exchange was extremely powerful. This showed the true importance of this topic for true overall health and as you  eloquently said probably, THE most important.\\n@1977dlove - This episode is just perfect timing for me! I have a cardiologist appt tomorrow due to extremely high HDL, High LDL, and a 1st degree family member who passed of a heart attack at 42 years old. I\\'m 46/female, excercise 6 days a week (1/2 weight 1/2 cardio) & terrified of statins. This episode took the edge off my anxiety by giving me specific information on what to talk to my doctor about. I have listened to your podcasts since day 1. They have all been super helpful - however, this one very well may allow me to die WITH any issues I may have rather than because of them. Thank you, from the bottom of my calcified (well, hopefully not \\n@nadinebenueza1439 - Thank you so much for enriching my life with so much knowledge (for free)! I have not been able to stop watching your vids here since I started and it has inspired me to keep learning as much as I could and make changes to increase the quality of my life and my loved ones. Thank you, Andrew for your interest (and deep love) in science!️ -avid follower from the Philippines\\n@lenaanders9514 - Thank you for this episode, Andrew, I learned a lot! I am also very interested in mental health (as I believe many of us are) and I\\'d like to suggest or at least kindly ask you to consider making an episode with Dr. Gabor Maté. It could be interesting hearing his ideas moderated by your straight-to-the-point questions. Thank you in any case!\\n@dariacompati8070 - Such a wonderful conversation! Feeling very thankful that Dr Attia included the part about emotional health. Sometimes it’s the only basis for everything else. People who don’t have hope and who suffer emotionally often don’t care about the agility of their limbs or insulin sensitivity. I’m coming from the country where so many people are unhappy and so many just binge drinking and smirk skeptically when you are trying to mention anything regarding health and wellbeing. And honestly even my own life at some point felt so miserable that I wouldn’t pay attention to what I was eating whatsoever, smoke minimum a pack a day and binge drink to the point of a blackout\\n@jscott4081 - Thank you so much to the both of you. This was amazing.\\n@divingsnow - Emotional health is our Achilles heel; at some point it will lead us fall no matter how great we are perceived by others and sometimes ourselves. Huge respect to Dr Attia and Huberman for sharing openly the trials of life. Were it not for friends, we may not ever get up.\\n@jasonneiss1169 - Firstly I wasn’t that into this episode and I started and stopped a few times but I’m very glad I did. The ending with the emotional health hit me very hard. I cried listening to Peter tell his story on the topic, and when he said he hopes that no one out there listening feels the way he felt. I could feel every word he was saying as if it were my own, the anger. I am in therapy and I’m still working to find the right medications. I’m definitely going to give the recorded message a try, I will try anything. Thank you for all your work \\n@csleung444 - Powerful vid. Totally relate to what Peter said abt anger and not knowing what the emotion is underneath and how much work/time it takes to figure out how im really feeling.  This helped me realize that i have really high standards for myself and others that may be unrealistic to expect of the general population and even my loved ones.\\n@massimilianobighi7472 - First video of your channel I watch. I LOVE IT! \\nIt’s exceptional. So many useful information, so much professionality to ask and answer questions from both of you. \\nThank you for your work sirs\\n@shellykeyes8389 - What a wonderful episode…so much valuable information! Incredible talk between gentlemen I already admired. I encourage all my friends/relatives to listen to this podcast!\\n@bjornbohley - Amazing episode. I came for the health aspect of it... Left with incredible knowledge and the understanding that healthy relationships probably mean more than living an extra 10 years.\\n@alexanderdlv - Me again.  Just finished the podcast and just want to say thank you, especially in regards to the personal experiences that were shared. It’s a relief to know that professionals like yourselves also experience different emotional stages.\\n@canarysings319 - Way to go Andrew and Peter. Peter I thank you for sharing your story of going to therapy. My heart could feel your emotions.\\n@YourCapybaraAmigo_17yrsago - This was a very moving interview and it was full of highly useful and valuable information to boot. A deep thanks to Dr. Huberman and his brave guest.\\n@sharonisabelle8029 - My grandmother was standing on the toilet seat changing a light bulb when she was 95 and fell and broke her femur. I was so worried but after 3 months of recovery she was back home and celebrated her 100th birthday last summer. This interview justifies how worried I was about her being okay. Of course she started her physical therapy right away and is a great patient!\\n@laceyarrie - Thank you, Dr. Attia, for your expertise and vulnerability. It means much more than you know. \\n@Gquebbqco - I set out planning on only listening to certain sections. Starting at the beginning I began to change my day so I can finish listening to the entire conversation without pausing. \\n\\nGreat conversation fellas!\\n@Natasha-fd8rm - Hi Andrew! Thank you for this. Could you do one on self-esteem, please?\\n@rhondanerren4797 - Loved this interview! Thanks to both of you for your investment in and passion for TRUE health care! Your dedication and honesty are amazing. \\n\\nI loved your book, Peter! I’m 20 lbs away from deadlifting twice my body weight…is that goal the same for women?? \\n@milenaradeva4230 - Thank you, Andrew Huberman! I was deeply touched from the last part of the conversation about Emotional health and Dr. Peter Attia sharing his journey.  The entire episode was super valuable but the last part was truly something touching.\\n@ahrengroesch8774 - Good on him for putting the emotional health content in the book. We have such a big problem because no one ever talks about this stuff.\\n@lisigetbusy - Thank you guys so much for this! What really baffles me here in Germany with healthcare is that I feel like treatments are never really focused on prevention but merely on treating existing conditions! If it wasn’t for my brother who had to go through a thrombosis I would have never found out that we are genetically predisposed to which is super important to know! And in terms of arteriosclerosis, it would be so easy for doctors to check up on that once a year but is never included in the basic check ups you get! You have to ask for it and even then it’s not guaranteed they agree. It’s frustrating\\n@jfitch1112 - This is a fantastic episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast!  Thank you Drs. Attia and Huberman.\\nI\\'d like to take that leap of faith for better sleep.  Where can I get started?\\nMany thanks!\\n@Broham0106 - This was a great episode. Is there any possibility of another episode that deep dives into the recovery aspect following strokes and neuroplasticity? I’m currently recovering from a brain bleed and my neurologist and neurosurgeon don’t know the cause or what recovery will look like so I always like hearing about it any time it’s brought up on the podcast.\\n@bryndishuldaasgeirsdottir6373 - Thank you for all you do but particularly for this episode.  Definitely a book I will buy\\n@monilaistorz - A very moving interview. Two beautiful young men doing great things for the world. Thank you.\\n@tomyang714 - Thanks for making the high-quality, digestible, and life-saving information free to the public. Special shout out to the courageous honesty, that is what makes this resonate close to heart. Thank you!\\n@cleohuggins8026 - What an epic exchange -  rivetingly informative and powerfully raw. 3 hours passed in minutes. Thank you!\\n@francesmcguinn2028 - Informative on so many levels and what an inspirational guy Peter is, his knowledge and honesty is astounding , Thank you\\n@chrisgalloengr - Really enjoy peter\\'s insights. Coming from a science background I sometimes have trouble following the conversation due to the medical jargon. It\\'s nice to have Andrew jump in to ask for an explanation.\\n@popkian - I love your content. I wish you could make a follow up episode to explain some of the technical terms that was used in this episode. Your content almost always is easy to digest for a non-technical person like me but parts of this episode was hard to follow and understand because so many technical terms were used without any explanation. Thank you for what you do. This channel is really making a difference in people\\'s lives \\n@thehealthytruth3046 - Thank you Peter,  for your story about how your anger was a large part of your life. Anger is still a huge part of my life. Alot like you. I am very good at drywall too. The sad part is I know exactly what you are talking about. I am going to try and your techniques to help get my anger and emotions under control. \\n   Very grateful for your podcast Andrew. They have help me in so many ways. By far one of the best podcast on YouTube. If not the best. \\n@m8g35 - Best podcast episode I listened to for a while. Thank you Doc Huberman and Doc Attia!\\n@tyecowan9796 - With his emotional journey and growth, it is clear why he felt it was important to write the final chapter in the book. I\\'m recommending it to my family members, because there is something there for each, and maybe, each will enjoy the whole book.\\n@kimberlymichael8992 - This podcast & the Drive are what keep me chasing functional fitness, I love it when you converge. I hope many people hang on till the end for Dr. Attias’ journey of emotional strength through vulnerability. He is a much different fellow than at his first TED talk, that is a good thing for him, and us. Hugs to both of you for sharing knowledge with the masses.\\n@MindNow - If you watch all of the Andrews Videos, I think you will have one of the most sustainable happy life. \\n\\nThank you, Andrew and his team and all of the guests he interviews ️\\n@robertladd1375 - Amazing episode. I have been following Peter for years since I first heard him on Tim Ferriss\\'s podcast. I have always been fascinated by his knowledge and articulate delivery. Hearing his own struggles made him even more relatable as a person. Thank you for sharing \\n@marilynbrandt7070 - The most amazing podcast I have had the pleasure of listening to.  So much detail.  I have Dr. Peter\\'s incredible book and I have benefited so much from Dr. Andrew\\'s YouTube presentations.  Thank you for your intellect and generosity.\\n@michelleoconnor9968 - Thank you so much \\nI absolutely love your teachings. \\nVery informative and life changing.\\nYou make every teaching very easy to understand and apply. \\n@ajleslie2 - This is gold!  Love listening to Attia and his vocabulary is so interesting.  I am reading his book and can\\'t wait to learn more about his emotional state.  I would also recommend the Joe Rogan podcast where Attia talks about swimming in shark-infested waters.  It\\'s creepy but exciting.\\n@wyewyezed - I\\'ve been watching your shows for the past few months now and have learned so much. Thank you for sharing all these ideas and interviewing fascinating and brilliant people. I get at least a few good nuggets of health benefits from each one. My favorite is the cold water at the end of showering, which I look forward to now and it keeps getting longer! I usually listen to your show while doing yoga, for 15-40ish minutes a day (usually 15 during the week), so they take a while to finish. \\n@lgpedersen - Respect for Both of you! You are changing the world and gratitude. \\nWe need book from Huberman.\\n@michelevisser-fitton1617 - Fabulous podcast, thank you. I am 66 and have familial hypercholesterolaemia/artherosclerosis, have had breast Ca and an MI. Currently working hard to remain vital and have found this podcast invaluable (although the acronyms at times stumped me). I will have to invest in Peter’s book!\\n@alleyinn1 - I loved the end of this podcast where Dr Attia shared his story.  Two brilliant, powerful \"strong\" men speaking with eachother about therapy and emotional growth was amazing- especially two ppl so renown in their feilds.  Sometimes it can seem like certain people are perfect/have it all figured out.  Sharing the vulnerabilities just makes you more incredible role models and examples. \\n@KellyWagnerKW - I have so much gratitude and respect for the depth & scope of information shared as always on this podcast and particularly during this interview.  Making this kind of content available free to the public is going to change humanity (and our education systems) in incredibly positive ways, so thank you.\\n@prostawru5551 - Great video as always!! It would be nice to listen an episode about Asperger syndrome and how to deal with it Supplements, live changes,behaviour!!\\n@svenseydler1975 - These two guys produce really high end important content! Great!\\n@jabaerga1 - Thank you for this video! Mental health discussion was perfect and full with compassion\\n@user-vu2dg1js5s - Thank you both. The information was very well discussed and I especially found the conversation re \\'drywall repair\\' truly helpful. Thank you for sharing such a personal journey.  I am so looking forward to Peter\\'s book.  Thx!\\n@Shannon_Vlogs - Wow. This whole podcast was a goldmine. Every portion just made me want to learn more. Great discussion\\n@MrCod4killah - I instantly bought the book after this episode. Good marketing!\\n\\nYour quality is out of limits Peter! Same goes for Andrew.  Thank you both for  allowing me to exceed my knowledge by far in contrast to the knowledge I could reach on my own.\\n@kimberlysmithcarlson1777 - Thank you for addressing the importance of emotional health being foundational to one’s general sense of well-being, vitality and overall health.  It is impressive for scientists to finally be open to talking about this.  The ‘feeling’ states of being are truly esoteric, mystical, immeasurable and transcendent sorts of experiences.  As human beings, we all can accurately recognize their presence or absence when we have or lack authentic connection, safety and the ability to be vulnerable and ‘seen’ by those that we love.   Self-hatred is an astonishingly common human experience as well.  Especially with people that have had complex trauma beginning childhood.  This kind of trauma leads to a myriad of defense/coping mechanisms that are adaptive in childhood but inhibitive to pure connection, happiness and growth as we age.  And they are prohibitive to evolution as well.  By sharing what you have in such an open and vulnerable manner, it gives me hope that more and more people on this planet can heal!  As within, so without - Tikkun Olam…\\n@bro7269 - I can relate so much with the discussion at the end. I left many holes in drywall as a young kid dealing with family stuff. I’m grateful I was able to see it at 45 years old. It’s a long time to carry that baggage. Accepting my imperfections is very difficult. I left the best job I ever had due to bad imposter syndrome. I still find it strange that some people who do the least expect the most while some people who do the most feel like they don’t deserve it.\\n@paranormalwithdave - Two of my favorite people on Earth, thank you for this podcast \\n@seanlief4488 - I\\'m a medical student and instead of studying for my upcoming exam, I\\'m listening to basically another medical lecture lol. Brilliant material.\\n@0yellah - I really wholeheartedly appreciate both Peter and Andrew for the work and intense passion for bringing this invaluable knowledge into the public realm. Andrew has such a simple and gentle way of conveying often rather complex points in ways that really resonate and Peter is just a machine of a human and his knowledge depth and ability to recite it at length on the fly is incredible. It was nice to see Peter open up a bit too, as he said usually his engineering brain is trying to analyze everything to the Nth degree but we are all humans at the end of the day. \\n@simpleselfhelp - The end about Peter\\'s childhood and retreat stuff is so valuable to me. Thank you for being an example of a grown up masculine man doing the inner work\\n@veronicaramirez-op4zp - Thank you Dr. Andrew Huberman and Dr. Peter Attia for this amazing podcast! As always phenomenal insight on every level of the key points touch in your interview!  Looking forward to reading his book.\\n@mikaylam.5957 - Really appreciate Peter talking about his emotional health. Peter and Andrew are people I greatly admire and with people I admire  I often think they would never make the same mistakes that I do which makes me feel awful about myself and my life. It is nice to hear that even he makes the same mistakes I do and has to work hard not to. It makes me feel less like an outcast. Love this episode and both podcasts\\n@kabanovga - I\\'ve been learning English for the last 2 years, and have invested a lot of money, but I haven\\'t seen enough return on my investment. However, after watching this podcast, I feel that everything wasn\\'t in vain. Thanks, Andrew, you\\'ve changed my life. \\n@jamiepatton9334 - Peter was absolutely honest here at the end, how vulnerable - which will be most helpful to so many. Thank you.\\n@andeerohwedder1899 - love it - thank you for ALL your work!!!  so useful  - I would love to see a podcast on PANS/PANDAS and you have Dr. Frankovich right there at Stanford.  this would be an amazing resource for all the families out there suffering through this, help to inform the skeptical medical community, and bring this diagnosis more to the front for families to consider as search for help for their children and often suffer through mis-dx after misdx.\\n@lynchs2441 - I always enjoy listening Peter and his knowledge, but this episode moved to higher level, to see him as human being.. thank you!\\n@love.drones - Hey Andrew, \\nI don\\'t know if you will actually read this but I met you this morning at Whole Foods. I tried to just play it cool when we met, but I didn\\'t get to thank you for all the work that you do. \\nI only have been following you since November, and you\\'ve already made a huge impact in my life.\\n@nancylodhie593 - THANK YOU.  After almost thirty years of service to Elders and their families, this information is sorely needed.  We are, after all,  \"elders in training\" from birth, yet most are very uninformed about how to age successfully.  This will not change until our society evolves and embraces this. \\n@jamestheredd - This was saturated in amazing medical wisdom. I may have to listen to this 5 times.\\n@slhilliard - Thank you for the video. Thank you doesn\\'t seem quite enough. The part re: emotional health was priceless. Currently on a similar journey to alter my self-talk. Looking forward to the next video. Oh, and I have pre-ordered the book :)\\n@chrismetka5288 - Wow. Phenomenal conversation with two extremely intelligent, exceptional communicators on a wide variety of topics. So glad to be a premium subscriber to support this podcast and the life changing protocols I\\'ve already employed! Please keep up the great work!\\n@brindagannon7643 - The amount of information is astounding.  I love watching Andrew\\'s interviews!\\n@susworld129 - Thank you both for an incredibly informative, helpful and thought-provoking evening.  It is always a pleasure to tune in to Dr. Huberman and his equally intelligent, equally very human guest.   Thank you.\\n@paulrondeau2517 - Another awesome podcast! \\n\\nIt would be great to hear more content on inflammatory autoimmune diseases/disorders (Ankylosing Spondylitis, RA, etc.) and how to manage inflammation as this came up a few times in relation to longevity but separates from the behaviors we have control over (ex. exercise, diet/nutrition, etc.).\\n@WasatchSmitty - This episode was absolutely revolutionary for me. I’m 27 years old but want to get myself as healthy as I can to optimize my longevity. I’d never heard of ApoB, but had it added to my blood panel after hearing this and it was eye opening. My levels came out to 98mg/dL. So my question is, what is the optimal diet for reducing ApoB without pharmaceutical intervention? Peter suggests reducing saturated fats and caloric intake, but I was curious if there was anything more than that. Thank you so much!\\n@Healthify360 - Great interview.  I loved the clear descriptions of actions we can take to proactively manage our health.  Andrew I also loved your acknowledgement of Peter and everything that he contributes to his listeners health.  Peter is someone I fully trust.  I extend my gratitude to both of you.\\n@yawni__emptysullivan840 - When he shares his story at the end, it really shook me. Very beautiful. Thank you both. \\n@rudiranck8656 - From emotional chapter onward, it went from incredible to one of the best pieces in the entire Huberman Lab. Show some respect and subscribe to Peter\\'s channel\\n@U2BMonk - This was one of the best. Peter’s humility and honesty is inspiring. Andrew, you brought out the best in him. Can you please do an episode on autoimmune disorders with an expert? Too much noise out there. Would love to know the science.\\n@lindamaturan2134 - Very important & informative,  thank you, more power to both of you.\\n@NihilisticAnarchist - Thank you Dr. Attia for your candor.  Dr. Huberman again had the interview of the year too early!\\nAn absolute trip in the most educational and relatable sense.\\n@artemissb6950 - The wealth of information in this podcast is unbelievable, thank you both so much!!!\\n@EtherTheReal - Tim Ferris, Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Andrew Huberman doing the trilogy of podcasts. Bless you guys, much much thanks!\\n@ybitran - It’s hard to even fathom the number of lives that will be extended and improved thanks to these two guys. Easily in the hundreds of thousands. What a gift to humanity, and what a monumental legacy. I pay the subscription to the Huberman Lab just to support and show appreciation. Can’t think of a better investment.\\n@riverlevity - Good to hear. Due to severe ongoing spinal cord damage caused by cervical stenosis I am on the path to loss of mobility of legs and arms, bowel and bladder control plus the pain that comes with it. I am in agreement with you on what is the sense of going on when you can no longer do what you want to do in your life. I too feel I would be better off dead.\\n@gazels11 - Just pre-ordered the book. Can\\'t wait to read it. Thank you Dr. Attia and Dr. Huberman \\n@olakickas - The end of the conversation was where a real conversation started for me.Thats where I could not stop listening.Power of vulnerability.Thanks for that share!\\n@nyltonalmeida4746 - Huberman, I absolutely love the content here and I have a theme suggestion: sweating and hyperhidrosis. I think that a lot of people have huge problems with it and such podcast would be truly appreciated by your audience. Thanks!\\n@matthew3496 - I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Ive smoked weed for the last 3 years every single day with no exception and after watching your videos on how dopamine works in our body finally realize that this is not healthy or normal, even if it feels \"great\". You are awesome. I am now only indulging in edibles occasionally and have also cut out energy drinks completely and no longer wish to drink alcohol unless it is with friends. Keep up your amazing work Professor.\\n@valjohnson5835 - 2 brilliant men. Dr. Attia is on such a higher level than most physicians.\\n@tobyhooker4975 - The smiles on both of their faces at the end. Priceless.\\nBoth informative and respected individuals. Fantastic!\\n@mirasaxena2113 - Thank you so much for this episode  So educational and valuable.\\n@wendymorison2994 - This was brilliant - thank you! I so appreciate Dr Attia\\'s openness and humility, and applaud his insistence on including the section on mental health, of course it is integral to overall health and wellbeing. I often think of how our lack of emotional resilience and mental wellbeing interferes with our will and ability to follow through on practices that we understand are good for our physical wellbeing, in a perpetual self-defeating cycle.\\n@desi6049 - Thank you! You\\'ve given me answers to the questions I\\'ve had about my stroke. Some of the answers were really complicated and I need to research them further. Thanks for posing questions to Dr Attia which simplified things somewhat.\\nAs a result, I\\'m increasing the amount of exercise I do. I\\'m also paying more attention to my quality of sleep and diet. Thanks again to both of you.\\n@lisakarlstein9061 - I absolutely agree!!! They both provide actionable information.  I always feel like I am sitting in one of Andrews classrooms!  Thank you so much Dr. Huberman and Dr Attia!!!\\n@davidwilson5588 - Wonderful discussion. Thank you both. \\n@mikeiaffaldano5190 - One of the best podcasts I’ve seen.  Thank you for sharing!  Excited to read the book!!\\n@stevef6523 - I just bought the book, downloaded immediately as it was available. Enjoying it right from the beginning. Thank you Peter and Andrew for sharing so much\\n@raxitbrambhatt6989 - This two are tremendous mentors in the subject of public health and to make people aware about the nuances of the subject ( even though difficult subject for experts) \\n@ProvidenceProducts - The value and quality of the section on emotions is stellar !\\n@emilyzfrani4156 - Would love to see you interviewing people who are well into their 90s and even 100s and get their take on health and what\\'s helped them live longer lives-- perhaps then relating it to science and different studies!\\n@sheenatiller3502 - “You can die with it or you can die from it.” Damn that’s profound!!!! Thank you!!\\n@petankosta - How cool would it be if Andrew and Peter join forces and create a podcast where they both talk to different experts, each complementing the other’s point of view. The humanity will thank you for it \\n@nickbuys2871 - I have followed, enjoyed,  and learned from Dr. Attia for quite a long time. I had no idea the extent of the inner rage/ hatred. It was as if he was talking about me almost exactly. Thank you for sharing and I that it will help myself and others.  I do understand how it feels,  and it is so difficult.\\n@stefanonderdelinden9557 - Peter, you\\'re enlightening the way you talk about these subjects. Thank you for this\\n@vg1403 - ️ Thank you both. I value you both a lot.\\n@angiereno7279 - Beyond Exceptional. I have followed you since Day 1, Andrew Huberman, discovering you via Lex Fridman, and have listened from the first Podcast onward. This is excellent material (so much, so much). Love how you pushed Dr. Attia on the Emotional Health aspect, and the openness of Dr. Attia\\'s reflections... so grateful. Thank you.\\n@robertgutierrez8403 - Congratulations to Dr Peter Attia for his new book,Emotional trauma,and the ripple effect thru your life is real and it is often disquised as many faces.We as humans are afraid when it come to uncovering our true feeling and lack the understanding of putting them in words and connecting the feeling with our actions,I am 67 and have tried over the last 25 Years to see the big picture\\n@arianebrand5544 - This was amazing. Besides the the cientific aspects, the personal aspects of this podcast, the honesty and the deep human atitude of both, Dr. Attia and Dr. Huberman, is outstanding. I feel very touched and impressed, for me mental health would be at least as important as fisical health. Thank you both.\\n@debrobinson857 - Dr. Attia has just picked up another big fan and follower.  Thank you, Dr Huberman, for sharing your friend’s insights and knowledge with us.  God bless you both!\\n@Deb.71 - I appreciate you both and enjoy the synergy between you. Your authentic respect and friendship shines through. Dr. Attia, thank you for sharing your story. I’m so curious about your thoughts on astronomy… your birth chart must be very interesting . Have you ever had yours interpreted?\\n@edemassogba847 - The last hour was really something. I so resonate with the anger part. Thanks for sharing and writing the book.\\n@TheFarmacySeedsNetwork - I\\'m listening to this on Spotify. Another excellent discussion is always. I\\'m very glad to hear that we\\'re not going to jump right to pharmacology for management of APOB, cholesterol, blood pressure and heart and artery disease issues. Issues. I strongly believe that if we fix the input, we may not need the pharmacology, jumping to pharmacology first is backwards in my opinion. Thank you so much for not jumping straight to pharmacology!\\n@pochuweb - This interview packs in so much useful information; covering the giant landscape of health in the most riveting and insightful way and wraps up the interview with an incredible, thought provoking ending.\\n@melothrien6774 - Thank you Dr. Attia for making the HUGE, expanded point about causation. This is what creates most scientific disagreement imho. Our society allows too much freedom in framing our experiments/theories that eventually turn into laws. We should require more scrutiny and transparency around these laws, but we just herd them through as if we’re too stupid to understand smh\\n@dawnrachel8187 - This episode was exceptional due to the emotional health segment at toward the end. Dr Attias story was an exceptional adjunct to the importance of how mental health is the health of the whole organism\\n@AnnaleeBelle - Really loved this one! Especially the focus on emotional health.\\n@missaloa3869 - Thank you for creating such a beautiful and informative video/podcast!\\n@marshalpeters - Psilocybin saved me from years of uncontrollable depression, anxiety and illicit pill addiction.  Imagine carrying heavy chains for over a decade and then all of a sudden that burden is gone.  Believe it or not in a couple years the be all over for treatment of mental health related issues\\n@PSgameFilms - Highly informative and absolutely fascinating. Much appreciated.\\n@Nah-ah - I listened to this podcast over 4 days… and wow! Thank you so much for bringing Dr Attia on! I’m a bit late to this great man… I’ve heard of him over the yrs and watched a few reels of him and few minutes interviews but I didn’t realise how much I needed to hear him on this long form interview. Very fascinating and intriguing man. I found myself even rewinding and listening to some of the wisdom be shared especially his self reflection process on his healing journey. \\n@ShawnEwingShaka - Best episode ever. Looking forward to reading and re-reading Outlive book. Thank you!\\n@bw2879 - Although the majority of this episode was about physical health, it was the portion at the end about emotional health that really stood out.  It\\'s pretty rare to come across a way of looking at something that you\\'ve legitimately never heard someone articulate before, and Peter\\'s point about solving for speed to repairing relationship damage was one of those \"holy crap, he\\'s right\" kind of moments.  And then his subsequent description of his own personal challenges/demons was just incredible as well.  \\n@heavychace513 - Dr. Huberman, would you please do a podcast episode on journaling and it’s effects on health and well-being? I want to incorporate more things in my life to make it easier to break bad habits and I’m trying to stack more behavioral changes in my favor, thank you for your time in advance and I greatly appreciate your content.\\n@maxheithmar334 - Andrew does such a good job of slowing down the conversation for the layman and adding in FAQs\\n@parentcoachcat - Thank you for your excellent podcast. I am a regular listener/fan and frequently have questions/comments, though this is the first time I\\'ve written to you. I was just listening to you talk about the use of hyperbaric chambers for TBI, and I\\'m wondering if there\\'s a case for using it many years after the TBI, or any significant head impact, has occurred. Thank you for your work and thank you in advance for your answer.\\n@SGM-ep9uv - Such a wholesome conversation between 2 adult men about emotions\\n@dmcCovers - Thank you Peter for sharing your journey through mental health!\\n@georgiaadams979 - I am a Hubner fan. Your guests are the most informative and most interesting as individuals! Thank you!\\n@davidjaeger2911 - PSA !! Dr atia mixed up mcg and mg when he reported his own 100mcg fentanyl experience in the hospital. 1mg is beyond a lethal dose for most people!\\n\\nGreat episode thank you both for your  work\\n@AboodCohen - Good to have Peter back! He’s awesome :)\\n@notice9218 - Awesome podcast! I\\'d really appreciate if you turned on closed captioning! Even though the computerized CC is imperfect, I personally find it very useful for complex discussions!\\n@brendaviola9075 - \"I don\\'t have to be a slave to the adaptations that came from that.\" BOOM.  Wow.  This was perhaps the best interview I have ever listened to - I remained captivated throughout.  Thank you!\\n@CalixtoErico - I am a relatively new to the podcasts, but it has been incredible to see how every episode - through different topics - explains and reinforces the value of maintaining healthy habits. And it starts with things as simple as drinking enough water. As a guy with 43 and who is ever more concerned with living long and well, it seems as if I have found a gold mine. Thanks.\\n@craigdarrah - I’ve heard Peter talk about ApoB at least 20 times and I always learn something new.\\n@eliteboxfitness - Very heavy insight into peters emotionl rollercoaster . Big respect . Very useful guidance as usual\\n@LasVegasSand_s - [Summary]Some notable points on blood pressure: 1. Managing your blood pressure should be an absolute priority and Peter measures it every day. 2)Most people measure blood pressure incorrectly--it has to be measured after at least five minutes of doing nothing (no getting up, getting active etc.) 3) Manual cuff produces a lower figure consistently, and there\\'s reliable cuff and stethoscope that could be purchased. Peter\\'s costs around 240bucks total.\\n@zhilahaghbin4766 - I just want to thank both DR. Huberman and Dr. Attia, 2 Gentle Giants now, who so humbly talk about their past demons with anger openly. I believe their sincerity and courage to share their hurts with the world will help millions others who are suffering now being in their past \"shoes\". I believe such transformation and generosity to share such points [about their childhood pain and rage ]with the world is the reason for today\\'s success and relative peace they are enjoying.\\n@user-vx3gb7je4b - Wow!  Great video.  While I found the entire show informative and interesting, my favorite topic was the importance of healthy mental status.  The last few minutes of the video blew me away.  Substituting negative self talk with comments you would give to a close friend...WOW!!!!!  This hit home for me!  All I can say is THANK YOU!  Thank you for sharing your private and personal thoughts and feelings.  This will help a lot of struggling people.  \\n@xaroumenotipota - Love Dr Attia’s work \\n@patricksandridge6242 - I feel lucky to listen to Andrew but even more because of the guests he has on. His inner circle ️ rocks \\n@1234CDAB - The entire segment about emotional health was sublime!\\n@constancechan7748 - Every book that Andrew recommends is a must read!\\n@dafinkadomuschieva8936 - Very informative and well-explained complexes issues. Thank you both!!!\\n@AtlasZero13 - True wisdom and knowledge exchanged free from outside influence. What an amazing thing to find in these times\\n@juliasteinmetz1662 - I expected brilliance, but was blown away by the soulfulness of this conversation. Dr. Peter Attia is knowledgeable and articulate, such a pleasure to listen to. One thing I especially like about him is how carefully he interprets the data and then boils it down to give common sense and actionable steps just about anyone can take. I pre-ordered his new book, Outlive, needless to say :)  Thank you, Professor Andrew Huberman, for inviting him back! One of the best episodes yet, IMHO.\\n@francisbertolini2538 - God bless both you men. I thank God for your talents and search for knowledge.\\n@dr3amb3ing - Peter\\'s analogy with the smoking point hits home how much of medicine is about treatment of diseases as they arise as opposed to preventing at the very onset of disease detection. What a great talking point that was\\n@fredericksoucy3596 - Fantastic episode. The part where Peter addresses emotional health - I didn\\'t expect such vulnerability from him. Both of these guys are quite models of masculinity!\\n@wayilzahid2676 - Great podcast...\\nGreat minds/ Profesionals\\nThank you both\\n@suzannebrice3865 - Excellent interview. Thank you so much! I esp liked the info on MRI’s. I try to never miss an interview/podcast.\\n@charlenecausey105 - Wonderful interview and information. Dr. Attia’s vulnerableness near the end of the interview was a huge takeaway. What he described about “cleaning up the mess”, after we blow it, is the way families can be fixed generationally. What a blessing! \\n@DeanWarshawsky - Amazing content! It would be valuable if Peter could interview people that are 100+ years old and have lived by the principles and practices he promotes.\\n@SportsguySports - Hey Andrew in previous episodes you have mentioned that you read comments on YouTube and have hinted at an episode based on why people choose or are attracted to certain partners. This sounds like an episode of certain interest and would be incredibly insightful. Thank you!\\n@idaalavioon8130 - Awww, really moved.  I’ve followed Dr. Attia for at least 10 years.  I’m a pharmacist and more recently an astrologer.  I went through something quite similar and in the spiritual community we call it “the dark night of the soul.”  More specifically, the series of eclipses in the summer of 2020\\nAnd also in May 2022 I found my mind completely hijacked by negative thoughts and I believe we were all meant to confront our shadow.  Bravo for speaking about it.  I’m proud of you,  myself, and humanity. Keep pushing forward, humanity is moving back up. \\n@MUST-TRT - Peter Attia - this is one of the most clearly speaking, precisely accurate speakers I\\'ve ever heard on any topic. One of the rare few who knows his material so well that he\\'s able to easily convey immensely complex topics with simplicity and relatability to others in a manner that is entertaining and able to be grasped. Thank you gentleman.\\n@alexrakir491 - This is the most brilliant podcast! Thank you!!!\\n@beckyjohnson5138 - I\\'ve just recently discovered you, and I\\'m so grateful. I especially loved the episode with Dr. Sara Gottfried. Please have her join you again!\\n@gita86 - Thank you for being so honest about the emotional needs\\n@honey4clover - “Do you want to be right or have a relationship?” Best advice I’ve ever heard in situ of conflict. People come from different background and our perspectives/values aren’t always perfectly aligned. Seek for understanding instead of conviction \\n@Kuruptsentience - Attia and Huberman? Perfect way to start the week\\n@brikenavokopola7198 - wow, almost 3mln followers. I\\'m so happy that I found and followed Andrew Huberman way before he started the podcasts. So glad to have been sticking here for such a long time! Thanks a lot!\\n@kates5994 - Thanks again guys you are wonderful for sharing so much knowledge.\\n@surfnick58 - Your podcasts are great! A good contrast would be to have Paul saladino as your guest in the near future.  Keep up the nice work \\n@robbobheimer901 - I have a perplexing blood sugar question for you.  About 8 weeks ago I got an a1c of 5.4 and some higher ldl levels at my annual physical. I was interested in lowering both of these - I was already exercising regularly and have an active job but I have since been ramping that exercise up in my current training cycle and have been averaging about 460min a week either resistance or zone 2 with some high intensity stuff.\\n@tosvarsan5727 - Peter is so great. Loved that, thank you Andrew for bringing this up\\n@LawDragOn - I owe my natty gains to Dr. Attia and Andrew.  True legends in the scientific community.\\n@cara753 - Long-time listener, first-time poster — I really enjoyed this, especially the end section about emotional health. Thank you.\\n\\nThinking about more nuanced, human experiences, as discussed at the end of this episode, I\\'d really like to hear an episode about the neurochemistry of a joke: making one, hearing one, and the brain circuits involved in humour generally. Thank you, Dr Huberman, for making this kind of discussion publicly available at no cost.\\n@Lovepeacejoy.. - Such a wealth of useful information. Thank you Dr. \\n@user-yr3si3qr7e - Dr. Huberman, I love your content, I\\'ve been listening to your podcasts for almost 6 months now and they have greatly improved my quality of life as a college athlete. I know when and when not to take icebaths, I know how to study more efficiently, how to recover better, and how to eat to perform optimally. The missing piece for me is where being a women falls into all of this. I can feel differences in training and cognition based on where I am in my cycle. The literature I have read on the female hormonal cycle and athletic performance has been conflicting or mostly about menopause. There\\'s so much research on hormones and fertility. We assume that losing our cycle means we are overtraining or unhealthy because we aren\\'t fertile. Is it conceivable that with intense exercise women temporarily lose their cycle because it isn\\'t an optimal time to get pregnant, but not necessarily an unhealthy state to be in? I just feel like so much of the literature on female hormones focuses on fertility. How much do we know about this? I would be so interested in a podcast that looked at female hormones and performance. I loved the podcast with Dr. Gottfried, but I feel like I was left with more questions than when I started. Yes female hormones can and should be optimized, but what does living and training in accordance with hormonal shifts look like for someone who already has a healthy cycle?\\n@nicoparissud6290 - What an awesome episode! Thank you so much Andrew and Peter!!! Peter mentioned that an inflammatory state may cause cancer in the long run. Does that means that people with inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn\\'s disease), psoriasis, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus etc. have an increased risk of developing cancer? Thanks again.\\n@martini1179 - Hi. I would love to see a podcast dedicated exclusively to executive functions, everything that hinders their development, and how to overcome those obstacles.\\n@jules153 - Thanks as usual Andrew!\\n@SirGalaEd - Sadly,  I fully and completely understand that hateful self-talk . I am over 60, and feel totally trapped into my own self hatred. I do EXACTLY what Dr. Attia describes, FREAKING EXACTLY! I truly hope there is some hope in the book. I just bought it. UPDATE: got my copy of the book yesterday.  Went straight to the last chapter first. It\\'s giving me actual hope that maybe I can learn to not hate myself.  But this chapter is hard to read because it\\'s too close to home.\\n@jean-louischarrier2754 - I have just read the book \"Outlive\" from Dr Peter Attia and I cannot stop recommending it to friends and family. It is by far the most interesting and accessible book on human health I have ever read. I am just lost for words on how important - to borrow the words of Professor Huberman - this book is to anyone who cares about their health and that of others that I do hope many many people will read it. Not only has Dr Peter Attia written a \"reference\" book that is a must read and possess to anyone he is also a very caring and humble person who possess a somewhat hypnotic and simple way of explaining concepts and subjects of a scientific nature if may say so. A wonderful podcast from Professor Huberman! Bravo and a big Thank You to both the interviewer and the interviewee.\\n@MrJustinthehull - Another incredible podcast.  I have learned so much from you and your guests, but how do we convince older generations the importance of things like type 2 fiber stimulation?  My own anecdote is that the 65+ people in my life think regular gentle walks are the most practical health preservation protocol and think resistance training is for ego or vanity. Walking is great, of course, but there is so much more...\\n@Mariaharris143 - 2:42:21 \\nI listened to this podcast in a few chunks over the last couple of months and came back to it today to finish it and I’m so glad I did. \\n@audiofender - Wow, talk about a timely episode for me. l was supposed to get 2 CT scans back-to-back next month. After hearing this episode and doing some additional research, I decided to cancel it, and I\\'m talking with my doctor about getting an MRI instead. Thank you for such great information!\\n@benezc4036 - My learnings:\\n\\nLongevity is lifespan and healthspan. Lifespan is how long you live. Healthspan is how long you are healthy for without disease or disability. Physical, cognitive and emotional.  \\n@brookenolly - Best part was toward the end! SO appreciate Peters vulnerability - can definitely relate to the bull in a China shop analogy \\n@user-lh5wv4vx5f - Thank Dr. Huberman & Dr. Attia, a brilliant and beyond informative discussion! A general question about the relationship of ApoB and LDL, could high LDLc, that includes a higher level of LDLa than LDLb, create high ApoB?\\n@hannahdreyfuss7120 - Wow. Perhaps one of the most insightful episodes and impactful segments from Peter. I hope he finds it in himself to write that second book.\\n@TJ_775 - Can you imagine meeting Peter Attia in person. ? This guy is so smart and well spoken, I would be scared to open my mouth. I sometimes wish he would talk in simple terms and at the end of the podcast his honesty and humility are inspiring. Great job, I highly appreciate and respect both guys.\\n@mrw4481 - This episode, especiallythe last third, is great!  Thank you so much! …..But there is another vital thing we need for longevity: peace! How could we arrange that?\\n@MosesRabuka - Maybe everyone can live beyond what they’re capable of\\n@livegolfismygt - Got the book! Super excited to delve into it\\n@shimokitazawa1217 - The final part of this podcast is so valuable! Thank you!\\n@metemad - Amazing podcast. Peter did the right thing by adding emotional health to his book. Lack of emotional health ruins all the care we do for our physical health.\\n@smoke5.036 - The fact that he knows all of this without notes or anything in front of him just blows my mind.\\n@shawn7102 - Thank you for all your free and important content. I’m sharing it with my MD dad. Please consider interviewing Dr. Bonnie Kaplan (professor and author—The Better Brain).\\n@seasidedavey - Do an episode about cocaine use, like you did alcohol and weed.\\n@robertjohnson4035 -   guys  ,  Truly inspiring , 56 had my check up all is good , zone 2 been doing from time  and memorial vo2 max 47 and rising, as for food my mum was a  7 day Adventist , so  Vegetables nuts fruits and fish , me and brothers all had bikes , whatever she knew  Science is proving it now . \\n@borisvos1971 - I\\'m incredibly grateful to have found your podcast.\\n@emilyevans6130 - Huge takeaway: It\\'s possible to change, \"undo\" an ingrained, defining behavior in four months after living with it for 47 years. Thank you, Andrew, for eliciting this inspiring level of emotional honesty from your friend -- on camera, knowing it would help others: If anyone questions whether they or someone they care about can \\'unlearn\\' unhealthy emotional behaviors, watch: 3:20:00\\n@cearilindubhlaoi9507 - I wish my Dr was Dr Peter ...he understands the human body for sure ...much respect  to both of you from Ireland 🇮🇪   \\n@AnthonyJones-us6zk - Thank you for speaking about how dangerous this fentanyl problem has become. It is real. I am a community mental health nurse and have lost several patients over the past two years to accidental fentanyl overdose. Interestingly enough I actually had a patient who had been admitted to hospital for a mental health crisis, they ran a tox screen and they tested positive for fentanyl. They are adamant that the only substance that they use is marijuana. I thought that quite terrifying as marijuana is considered very benign as a substance. There are fentanyl test strips available that I regularly give my patients that use substances and I encourage them to test their batch (typically of crystal meth) before they use it. That way they are aware of what they are using, in case it’s laced. The drug landscape has become down right frightening. Thank you again for talking about this issue.\\n@michaelkossivas - ˌaTHərōskləˈrōsəs\\n@systemizesuccess - Fascinating, thank you. Be interesting to know if Dr Attia experienced what appeared to be physical pain, in any part of your body, that disappeared\\nonce you found a way to release the rage/emotions trapped inside?\\n@sylviakeyser3845 - Brilliant podcast, extremely informitive.\\n@warner476 - Great discussion on general health - and i think I understand most of it!\\n@friedapembrook8449 - Dr Attia in my opinion is the example of a perfect human being. I know there’s no such thing as a perfect person. I feel that this doctor is perfect as a doctor and perfect as a human being. Can’t wait to read his book. I love both of you guys. Thank you for this podcast.\\n@underdogblade4699 - Tbh, I didn\\'t watch this one yet, but came here just to ask a question. I\\'ve just discovered your podcast a few months ago and I\\'m going through a list of the ones I saved for now. I appreciate you and I\\'m so grateful for everything you\\'re doing to share the knowledge for free.\\n@noreturn4396 - Why are you deleting comments that raise legitimate concerns? A credible statistician called you out, don\\'t hide it - address it.\\n@katherinegarelli2889 - Thank you for giving us this amazing knowledge.\\n@alexkarasz6186 - I wish more people were obsessed with longevity and human well-being like these guys clearly are.  \\n@bobby1347 - Absolutely love your podcasts. I hope one day you do a podcast on  acupuncture and science behind it.\\n@lanael7278 - I am a female version of Peter. I have the same degree of perfection that tortures me. So good to hear his revelation.\\n@joebedale5666 - Amazing show! All of your shows are top- notch, but this is standout!\\n@daleschimpf - Just listened to this, my first, over on Spotify. Great content which warrants another listen to really fully grasp everything. One thing I was curious about, and perhaps I missed it, but in relation to diet, I hear talk of eliminating/reducing sugar intake in order to mitigate inflammation in the body. Is this actually a thing and how does it relate to everything talked about in this podcast? Thx for the great content.\\n@kurtschmidt4621 - @Andrew Huberman\\nThis episode was amazing. I was never so engaged in listening to a conversation of yours and I have gone on to buy Dr. Attia’s book “Outlive” I’m in the middle of it now and he touches on things multiple times that sound reminiscent of Dr. Steven Gundry and his book “The Plant Paradox”. \\n@kenbangun6799 - Danke sehr, Prof! Really appreciate the personal story shared by Dr. Attia at the end.\\n@alexandrahope1723 - Another fantastic episode - thank you! Could you please do an episode on red light / red light therapy?\\n@scottgibson92 - This is excellent. I can\\'t wait to read Peter\\'s book!\\n@yerieldominguez8054 - Thank you for this. One of the best 3 1/2 hours of dialogue I’ve ever heard.\\n@ljrkrispes - I need a transcript of this--in fact, as a lifelong Premium member I am hoping to see those transcripts soon.   I just can\\'t take notes fast enough!   And I am halfway through OUTLIVE already\\n@RitaH22 - Bless you both and your families \\n@manelsalido - To be aware of your own mortality is indeed a great thing. It brings me peace.\\n@jala1081 - Loved this will join your podcast. I had been giving up on myself(66years) and after hearing this have recommitted to my health\\n@RhinaAlvarado - One of my top favorite Doctor after Zash Bush and before Jason Fung.

Dr. Peter Attia - Outlive - The science and art of longevity.\\n@bradtoney812 - Thanks so much for such outstanding content.\\n@TessS-xe3em - Thank you for the fantastic info. Regarding your recommendation for power lifting to prevent osteoporosis and osteopenia - what are your thoughts on those who have spinal arthritis and have been discouraged by their doctors from lifting heavy weights?\\n@user-cz4nj3ot6s - Wonderful information in every way! Thanks so much!\\n@themessenger8608 - The openess that occured regarding emotion was incredibly Veritas....it helped me immensely. I transcribed all the interviews with Neil Peart for the only official biography about RUSH and what I can recommend in a book is Neil Pearts book Ghost Rider regarding pain sorrow tragedy and self worth\\n@angelar3625 - Thank you both so much , for ure time ,  great information . It s been awsome interview . esècially the part about mental health \\n@motivason - \"A\", I\\'m so glad our generation is becoming much more aware. My father retired two years ago as charter/airline pilot and he was so strict with his health when we were growing up. We even made fun of him because he ate straight wheat and no salt on his food. He watched what he ate, always walked for exercise and checked his bp every day. He did this for two reasons 1. he had to pass the FAA medical exam every six months to keep working. 2. high blood pressure runs in his family. And lets just say, he retired well over the maximum retirement age.  So, I say all this so others understand that these small changes can make a HUGE difference in our quality of life and longevity.\\n@SgtSam1 - Amazing episode! How do I get my Dr to understand these things? Shoot, how do I get a Dr like Attia? Why is it Dr’s like this aren’t covered by insurance? The everyday person needs care from this type of Dr\\n@CarolRudowsky - Attia is a VERY SMART GUY! Thanks Andrew for sharing his thoughts as promoted by your inquisitive questioning!\\n@lizusi2040 - I really enjoyed your podcasts! I’d learned so much! I really appreciate it! Also wanted you to invite Dr Boz she has a book called Keto Continuum it’s about Autophagy it’s like the combination of Dr Peter and Dr Panda… using keto and fasting to recover from many diseases!\\nI really hope you will invite her! Thank you Dr Huberman!\\n@stronkwurks8769 - I absolutely love how Andrew always asks the distinction between smoking/vaping and marijuana/cannabis. Perhaps the vaping query can be further defined in the future to distinguish between vaped liquids, and vaped raw plant matter, and at what temperature it becomes harmful.\\n@LTJBLTJB - Consider inviting Dr Robert Lustig to the podcast. He is an expert in nutrition and metabolic syndrome and he as well wrote a book a couple of years ago talking about the processed food problem worldwide especially the added sugars. The amount of overlap in information shared by Dr Attia and what he usually talks about is impressive. He also seems like a really nice guy overall.\\n@eleanorafable - I wish we had Dr. Peter Attia as our biochem professor back in medical school. \\n@AndrewSartov - Thank you! It\\'s very important and useful what you\\'re doing.\\n@juliefredericksen2326 - One of the best interviews ever! Buying the book now . .\\n@andytavs2890 - What an inspirational bunch \\n@markispink - I can listen to this conversation like forever. \\n@davidchaput2841 - This is a request for Dr. Attia and Dr. Huberman to take a serious look at iodine supplementation in the diet and how incredibly it lowers cholesterol naturally and provides for strengthening in the immune system and many other metabolic functions and of course, how iodine can help in the fight against cancer. I would really love to hear a deep dive discussion into this subject.\\n@ThomasMarciniak - It was definitely the right decision to include the final chapter. Thank you Dr. Attia\\n@stephaniehale2401 - This. Was. Everything. \\nLove both of these guys\\n@sophiebader8966 - incredibly honest and sincere\\n@jlopezcalleja - You’ve made an impact on my life. \\n\\nThank you\\n@yanapl9158 - I recently found a supplement on Amazon with all ingredients Andrew told that increase focus and motivation. I didn’t know that they started selling them but it really works. \\nThank you!\\n@HetuParekh - “How not to die “ is a great book by Dr. Greger , published several years ago, looking at top 15 causes of mortality in the U.S., and nutrition for prevention. \\n\\nI would love for Dr. Huberman to interview Dr. greger and Dr. Barnard, two of my fav nutrition docs\\n@grampafitness9732 - I haven\\'t gotten further than 17 minutes in, and I\\'m already silently cheering ... back in 2000, my father had his first noticeable stroke, at the tender age of 60. Word salad, slurring, fully conscious and able to understand others but unable to be understood. His colleagues had to convince him to go to the ER. He recovered reasonably well and lived to 81, but both of his parents were also taken down by strokes in their 70s, and all three of these forebears had bad quality of life in their last few years. But then there\\'s me. I\\'d been told about my \\'borderline hypertension\\' since my teens. It was always in the 130-140/85-90 range, and I kept being told \"well, keep an eye on that, but it\\'s not so bad.\" Meanwhile even back then, the evidence I was aware of (as a non-specialist with a bit of training in the sciences) seemed to be converging on two points: long-term hypertension appeared to have consequences, and the definition thereof was creeping lower and lower. My BP had been very consistent in this \\'borderline\\' range, whether I was overweight, underweight, or in the middle, whether my life was relatively stressful or not, whether I was exercising regularly or not. After my dad\\'s mini-stroke, I marched into my doctor\\'s office and said \"Enough with 20 years of telling me to keep and eye on it: we need to see if I can control this better.\" I\\'ve been on a couple of different BP medications since then, and generally speaking I do well. In my early fifties, I \\n@alexanderdlv - Serious question. So today I decided to take some time to watch this episode and you gentleman talked about CT scans and by pure coincidence I got two yesterday and the drs told me it was safe. I’m concerned now. If I was exposed to something, how long do I have to expect symptoms if the situation goes sour? Thank you.\\n@wesrc - Loved this interview! The asbestos and lead warnings you see all over CA is due to Prop 65 warning, which requires environments/material that contain a certain amount of carcinogens to have a visible warning. Most of the limits are much lower to be concerned with. You will even see prop 65 warnings on certain foods that have ingredients that come from ground.\\n@plionas - Amazing content! You might want to consider subtitles for the hearing impaired or the non native speakers!\\nKeep enlighting us!! Thank you!\\n@katieforeman7947 - It\\'s amazing to me that Andrew has never heard of Dr. Michael Gregor\\'s book How Not to Die. That is the single best compilation on the science of health and longevity. It is well-documented with literally thousands of studies and I highly recommend it.\\n@cherylnathan5512 - An awesome episode, as a  smoker for forty years who now capes as allergy to patches and gum, I guess weaning off the vape is a good idea after hearing the advice. Cheers \\n@houndofzoltan - Big fan of the show here. I\\'m a pronunciation teacher, I think Peter\\'s book is called OutLAST, second syllable stressed, as a verb in the form of an exhortation. \\n\\nWhen you say, OUTlast, it sounds like a noun, like \"OUTcast or REbel\".  \\n@andrewcheng1998 - I found myself something stuck with looking for perfection too much ( or optimizing stuff ) too. But IMHO it should be something Dr. Attia could feel easier about it because that is probably something that push himself that far in his career too. And some people did love and appreciate you before you realize your anger issues.\\n@angelocastiglione1 - Great interview! Thank you \\n@BaskingInObscurity - That waist-vs-height ratio rather that BMI makes a lot of sense. \\n\\nOn my 40th birthday I stood 73 inches tall and weighed about 225 lbs with a 37-38\" waist. Two years down the road, due to profound Depression and not affording a gym membership anymore, I lost a little more muscle mass and put on a small amount of weight, almost 40\" waist at 235 lbs. Then cancer and intensive chemotherapy, partway through which I dropped below 190 lbs in maybe two months and stopped weighing myself before completing the chemo regimen. My waist still never dropped below about 36\", MAYBE 35\" at the nadir. Then I was neutrapenic and on antibiotics for several months, plus had my sternotomy and tumor resection 4 months AFTER chemo finished—point being I wasn\\'t capable or even allowed to try to exercise more than walking until the sternotomy healed up. By then I was 245, looked like a shmoo, and had clearly lost a great deal of muscle that ended up replaced by body fat. \\n@legacyb3798 - AWESOME AND LIFE CHANGING INTERVIEW\\n@simonesoupen138 - love how he simplified so much for us normies to understand\\n@zakatista1330 - I’ve worked with post fall geriatrics (some much younger people also).

Here U gave some real good advice. I am really convinced, I will buy a classical Riva Rocci set and use it at work for the sake of my clients.\\n@sarahbinkley31 - Amazing content! You’re both amazing\\n@mrvcy - First time I had my LDL and HDL checked, I was 12 or 13 years old and it was high. Now, 25 years after, I am using statins for nearly two years. But my doctors didn\\'t talked about Apob, I will ask them about it. Thank you \\n@afrothundar - I don’t think I’ve ever been more excited for a book lol, I’ll be at Barnes and Noble to pick it up Tuesday.\\n@kristinrigby8952 - I\\'ve been keto for 3 years and my triglycerides were 8 when I tested recently. \\n@laurentgaildraud9164 - heartfelt podcast.

Thanks a lot.\\n@One-Ring-To-Rule-Them-All - I would love to hear a bit more about kidney health and prevention of kidney disease, please. Dr. Attia mentions how important kidney is and I hoped for some more info on that...\\n@michaelcolasurdo2622 - Dr Huberman, I think you could have a great discussion with certain psychoanalysts and Hegelian philosophers.  Especially Richard Boothby, many of his books go in depth with the role of vision and psychic life.  Also Mari Ruti and Todd McGowan would be great on your podcast.  All of them and many others could provide interesting crossover discussions.  I think Hegel, Freud and Lacan would be great detour discussions for your show\\n@nathanfiori2931 - I can\\'t explain how valuable this podcast is. I am a 21 year-old male with FH (Familial Hypercholesterolemia) and had LDL levels north of 250 mm/dL at just 13 years old. I have been on atorvastatin since because it seemed like the only option at the time. I have been to countless cardiologists and lipidologists and not a single one of them could give me an explanation or provide solutions like the ones in the video. It has basically been \"take your statin and deal with it\" my entire life. The first time I was ever given information on this subject to where I could understand my actual problem and take appropriate action was during my upper-division physiology classes in college. It shouldn\\'t take a physiology degree to have access to this information. A doctor never once mentioned ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors. Thank you for putting this out on a free platform where people can actually watch and understand.\\n@crustybunny2475 - Spot on about kidney function. I have controlled BP with medication. My kidney function should be 97% it was when my BP was uncontrolled at 67%.At 53 that freaked me out. Last test 81% better but needs improvement. \\nSalt is poison to people with high BP. \\n@nitinmehrotra6016 - This is your best Podcast Dr Huberman!\\n@gutsygutsy433 - Love this interview ,,very clear :)\\n@lajuana2753 - 3M here we come!!

Thank you for your content. \\n@andreibaractari3752 - Hey Andrew, I was wondering if you had any videos talking about ear health or are planning on making any episodes talking about ear health. Im 18 and I know a lot of my friends and I tend to listen to really loud music where it’s when driving around, working out at the gym, or even just doing homework. I’ve heard conflicting results about how much volume is ok and the best way to preserve your hearing in the long term while still enjoying blasting out some music in a gym session. \\n@celwise - Tremendous episode!

I really want to know if it is not intrusive how can Dr. Hubermann ended with apoB high if he seems to follow all of  the new rules for well being. I have apoB on 98 and Trigl on 48 so I don\\'t know what to think or do\\n@DocJon1 - Brilliant man , thank you Prof Huberman.\\n@lydiabutler8634 - Fantastic conversation I wish you all a happy and healthy life span.

I had to overhaul my whole life when my gp said I had hypertension at only 32 and since then I’ve lost 16kg and my blood pressure readings have been amazing !! Healthy at every size is a lie !\\n@omarhdj6727 - I wish you could do an episode about male pelvic floor, a lot of men are suffering from it. Pelvic pain, tightness, weakness that lead to erectile issues and this can happen at all ages\\n@jfcfilms3883 - sounds like Elon Musk should go to Peters therapist and send him some of these audio files . One of the greatest podcasts I have heard in long time. Can\\'t wait to get my ordered book in the hands.\\n@shareenorton6940 - So informative!  I am reading OUTLIVE and it is an eye-opener!  Now, I also want to know what Dr. Attia is DRINKING in this interview.  What is in that ball jar? :)\\n@MrManimal88 - Incredible value. Thank you. Comment on prostate cancer screening being easy way to prevent death. Because the serum PSA biomarker, traditionally employed in screening, is a bit of a flawed biomarker with non-optimal sensitivity and specificity, the USPSTF kept juggling with recommendations for its use. The consequence is rising prostate cancer incidence since 2012/2013 until now, of which advanced stage disease makes up ~50% of these cases. That’s alarming, and hardly an easy situation. It’s also not easy to screen for, because we’re still looking for better alternatives. Many people probably get unecessary biopsies because of this blood test. To have an ‘easy screen’, I can imagine some fast MRI protocol combined with a more comprehensive risk calculator. Research is also dabbling in radiotracers, but thats radiation. Prostate cancer needs new and improved screening tools involving targeted MRI and better risk-adapted strategies. Thanks.\\n@Runnifier - This podcast is incredibly good\\n@isaarunarom7830 - Broad jump was my competition in HS 12feet no training, I wanted to run 100m and 400m relay. Becuase I was really good at 100m and enjoy sprinting all out. But after a 12ft broad jump first try I was trapped, it was tied with an old school record so the coaches made sure I competed in it.\\n@Seabeams - 1:45:20 everyone else has commented on the wonderful discussion about emotional health towards the end, so I’m just time stamping the part that made me grin. My aunt runs out of the room every time the microwave is on, but I can’t ask her to listen to this part for fear of scandalizing her.\\n@jory320320 - Of all the terrible health conditions we can have and should try to prevent, Dr. Peter Attia put mental health and emotional health and the top of his priority list.\\nAnd the top impacts on emotional health are community and connection.\\nThat\\'s pretty remarkable and worth taking away to digest and think about.\\n@modhumitarakshit310 - Thank you for this interesting and informative podcast.\\nJust wondered what the statistics say about muscle ageing for say a healthy 40yr female who hasn\\'t been gyming or going to the gym for regular exercises but been doing yoga exercises instead.\\nAre yoga exercises not an option if am not interested in working out for my muscles ageing???\\n@miltonperez9402 - Andrew, I\\'m from argentina and trough my wife I\\'ve became a great fan of your work, thanks and congrats!!!\\nI got lost regarding cholesterol and nutrition because first Peter says that what we eat don\\'t have any impact but then he talk about nutrition and saturated fat and is like there is a link anyway.\\nI was trying to get some insight for my nephew case. He is 23 years old, very skinny, in carnivore diet (100% and very strict). He is a fan of carnivore diet, feels great physically an mentally. But he has cholesterol in 500 since 2 years ago when he started the diet and my sister is going crazy because she and her husband are both graduated in biochemistry (in their 50\\'s) and they are death worry about him dying at 30 because of the cholesterol at 500 and all the professional knowledge they have about risk of cardiovascular deseases and cholesterol (you have talk about this topic and doctors education a lot and both of them are a good example)\\n@davidgrimes4726 - Although I disagree with Dr. Attia about how incontrovertible the evidence is that ApoB particles are almost singularly causally atherogenic, I think he a provides a wealth of knowledge, critical thinking, and now I realize self-reflection and humility. I particularly like how he challenges the conventional medical standards of health as really setting the bar far too low. Great podcast Andrew and Peter!\\n@_flowuniversity - This was a beautiful conversation\\n@elsawiegers1093 - thanks for another great podcast! just keep looking and one finds everything necessary!\\n@nahidnipa721 - The emotional part was mind blowing. Enjoyed that part and will try to apply.\\n@iankundil1875 - Thank you! Lex called you “national treasure” and you are. I have to ask is it posible for you to shed a light on CFS (Chronic fatigue) ? Current situation any progress, any hope for cure? Thank you!!!\\n@markleone6700 - This is what is spectacular about the internet. That a schmuck like me can plunge the depths of two intellectual giants like Huberman and Attia. Amazing interview.\\n@roningeman3048 - This was best podcast I\\'ve heard with Peter Atilla.

A decent Littman stethescope, more than adequate for taking blood pressures is $57 on Amazon. \\nHe is so right about the blood pressure difference between walking in and sitting down and taking the blood pressure vs relaxing for 5 or so minutes then taking it. I experienced this just today and there was a 20 mm Hg difference.\\n@susanminihane5268 - I look forward to and listen to each episode, every week. I have learned so much and made changes in my lifestyle based on the information presented; thank you for your work, Huberman Lab. However, this was the first episode that I didn\\'t like. The level of detail and \"geek speak\" was at its\\' maximum height. This episode would be excellent for the AMA and doctors (esp. radiologists) but I found it difficult to follow and cumbersome at times. The takeaways were not new - get adequate sleep, move/exercise, eat well, reduce/eliminate alcohol & cigarettes, monitor your BP, get colonoscopies, and stay away from drugs. Nothing new nor enlightening. Then again, any guest after Dr. Panda would be hard to follow....\\n@simonedupre7169 - Andrew, you\\'re awesome!! Thank you for everything you do!!!\\nBut, how can you cowboy hyperbaric O2 at home? Great idea BTW!\\n@carolr.556 - I do appreciate both Andrew and Peter sharing their personal struggle with cholesterol and trying to help us.. But would appreciate discussing the \\nAPO -A and it’s ratio with APO-B because we who have high APO -B  would feel more reassured if our APO - A being towards the high end is lowering cardiovascular risk.. My APO-A is 177..APO-B is 109.. so the ratio is 0.61 putting me at lower risk..correct?\\n@rossbabcock3790 - For me, the risks are just too great! I used niacin therapy to finally resolve my depression. The only side effect was flushing once and a while. I think it\\'s best if my brain remains locked. I really don\\'t want to look that deep into it!\\n@lplegend2010chelsea - one of the best interviews to date\\n@khaledzurikat7190 - Patenting in the spirit of emotional health!\\n@AtRandomly - 3hours onwards - thank you. The matter of fact vulnerability is so refreshing/liberating.\\n@Joseph1NJ - I applaud Peter for revealing his emotional issues. I\\'m guessing most of us have them, very few of us seek treatment, and fewer even have access. For those that have basic, limited access and seek treatment, it usually comes in the form of a pill. As if our healthcare system wasn\\'t already failing and in crisis, emotional healthcare is virtually non existent, unless of course you\\'re happy with your treatment coming in the form of a pill, or even multiple pills. That is so scary, most won\\'t even seek treatment for that reason alone. I\\'ve seen these treatments turn people into zombies. It\\'s freakin\\' scary what psychiatry does to people. Worse, GPs are giving out SSRI\\'s like they\\'re antibiotics these days. How in the hell is a GP who allocates not more than 5 minutes to a patient, with zero psychiatric training, qualified to be giving mind altering medications to desperate patients I\\'ll never know. Gotta love big pharma. These people are more powerful than entire governments, as we\\'ve seen quite vividly since 2019 when covid hit the planet.\\n@mariacristinacatala301 - in the 90s, I did many brain scans at Stanford University medical center for a PhD student. It was a paid study for depression. I went back several times per year over four years. Even after I moved to Los Angeles, I would make the drive up for her. Now I wonder if they were MRI or CT scans.\\n@sonjaforrester9255 - I can totally relate to only understanding my positive and negative moods at the ends.  I mask a lot with anger!\\n@matt75hooper - New senior citizen.    6 weeks with absolute zero sugar in my diet. None.    10 pounds fell off, feel great.  34-36 waist pants.     Highly recommended.\\n@Bpjames - I\\'m generally in the camp of being anti-pharmaceuticals, especially in the case of statins, but Dr. Attia is the only voice that I trust in media that makes me reconsider that stance.\\n@adrianagiraldo9315 - HuberMondays with More P.

Highly recomend reading Dr. Attia\\'s book!\\n@josepht.7937 - I am a gentleman. A peaceful guy No question. The uber-masculine competitor in me, however, would love to see both of these men in a fight with each other! The deep voices, the muscles, the absolute certainty in which they speak, the testosterone in the room is off the chain (in a good way, of course).\\nOutstanding informational interview! \\n@ketherwhale6126 - OMG this guy is SO knowledgeable not only theoretically but he has the science DOWN!! \\n@lilla_bjoernen - Dear Mr. Huberman, would you consider doing an Interview with Manuela Mischke-Reeds on Somatic Psychotherapy? It seems we depend so much on our mind, not considering the intelligence of the whole bodily system. Came across this topic in my breathwork studies, and I really believe people should know more about it, so that they can come back into their body and more into their feelings. \\n@vancetar5726 - 10/10 much love to the free and honest info.\\n@stevemc2626 - Like I do every Tuesday morning (here in Australia) I listen to every minute of the new episode. Absolutely love them. But in fairness I think you should have a discussion with an alternative view on heart disease and statins. These issues are not settled as Dr Attia would have us believe. Perhaps speak to a cardiologist like Dr Aseem Malhotra who will present a different view point in relation to the cause of heart disease. To not do that would surely be considered unscientific. Science needs to be challenged to find the ‘truth’.\\n@user-ie2hj3mh4s - The content is great as always, but it\\'s really disappointing that the episode discussing longevity and health span doesn\\'t reference or mention the extensive scientific publications on the benefits of a whole food plant-based diet for health. Instead, I\\'ve heard multiple references to steaks, butter, and so on in other episodes. \\nFor the next guest, I suggest inviting Dr. Michael Greger.\\n@monisa456 - Andrew Huberman, how can we get rid of the addiction and stop smoking? They\\'re putting Pyrazines in the tobacco to make us more addicted! Please make a video of that if your know the answer. \\nThank you for all the incredible informative videos you\\'ve made and gave us for free, i\\'ve learned soo much, thank you <3\\n@broderfransoder2768 - One of the best podcasts i have ever heard!\\n@JustineDodd - Amazing discussion ~ so much to digest. \\nOn the topic of smoking and vaping, which covers a plethora of different substances and varied results, more so now than ever before. \\nThere is the initial ‘vape’, a fairly expensive device created to vaporize herbs at the correct temperature to maximize thc or cbd extraction from weed, and the subsequent vapour is inhaled. These seemed like a healthier method to deliver the substance.\\n@evaprokop6516 - Amazing, Thank you, at 71 I’m happy to listen and learn. Time we’ll spent.\\n@shannonshanahan-cg7ys - The reason that Joe Rogan podcasts are so great is because Joe is kind of a regular Joe. He will ask questions that bring the guests down to earth and help the common person understand. Contrast to this conversation where these guys are hardcore encyclopedias. I mean it\\'s great now for a particular audience but I am missing the forest through the trees here.\\n@melbaT2770 - Now that I have the MTHFR heterozygous gene mutation and doing some research, I advise everyone to get tested for it. This gene mutation leads to different types of cardiac issues when homocysteine levels are high along with low folate levels. Also, neurodegenerative diseases are included.\\n@maryannehill8821 - Please Could you have a speaker on the podcast to discuss METABOLIC THERAPY in particular for Cancer patients. I think this is so relevant for so many people to learn about.\\n@vanz1330 - Great up to date information!

They work well for movement disorders, fibromyalgia and skin health!\\n@dorzhowe1305 - Wondering if you have done any studies on whether meditation can make up for poor sleep.? I struggle to get even 5 hours sleep a night and if meditation could in some way compensate for this I would love to hear about it.\\n@digital-sanctuary - I wish my physician would be like him.\\n@lisinbondi1240 - I have a lifestyle that supports very healthy aging by considering all these areas, but I also love a good Pinot Noir sometimes so the chapter on emotional health is the best reinforcement of my grandmother\\'s philosophy of \\'what you need and a little bit of what you like\\' . She shuffled off at 96 and my goal is to be like her (PS she had high blood pressure from her late 20\\'s and took the medications prescribed)\\n@brucehutch5419 - This is my third podcast with various interviewers concerning Peter Attia\\'s book \"Outlive\".\\nThere\\'s no accompanying captions or transcript with this.

When I listen to things that are involved and I want to learn I listen and read the words to obtain best comprehension.\\n@swirlinember1974 - Hi , I just had a neuralogical perception revelation just now. It doesn\\'t have anything to do with this episode which I will watch but wanted to share it here cause you know, interested nerds like me are here.  I routinely touch my teeth with my tongue and notice things about them like the roughness or smoothness of a clean tooth, the textural  difference between the  implant tooth I have and the real ones or the  good old I feel this bit of granola stuck in here.   So it was the granola (which I am still noticing as I write this- with my tongue)  that led me to use my finger to feel for it to get it out that I then realized that my finger\\'s  perception of the size of my teeth  was much smaller than how my tongue \"read\" the size of my tooth.  My tongue \"thinks\" the teeth are much bigger than whet the tips of my fingers tell me they are.  Super weird huh!?\\n@catherineholmes3574 - Just listened to this episode and wonder if this is the right place to ask: Why is my hemoglobin and hematocrit always below normal levels, but my ferratin is far above normal levels. I am technically anemic, but not because of low iron. After my first birth, I needed a blood transfusion because my hemoglobin and hematocrit was so measuring so low. I\\'m pregnant again and want to avoid this. But how do I get all of that stored iron (ferratin) into my blood (hemoglobin/hematocrit)? Where is the broken link in the chain... thanks!!\\n@carlor.s.4742 - I am really fascinated with medicinal mushrooms & a man I would love to see you interview is Paul Stamets, a most fascinating and knowledgeable mycologist.\\n@marjanemoghimi4933 - The utmost interesting episode, listen to it 2 times.\\n@Brian-lb3zo - Is the spreadsheet that is used for taking blood pressure readings for two weeks and calculates the average reading available?   I am sure I could create it, but thought it would be helpful to see it as a template.\\n@josecabassa8890 - Hello.  I follow you and Peter Attia and love what both of you do.  This podcast is amazing but the blood pressure discussion is disappointing.  There is so much nuance there that is missing related for stroke and hypertension management.  I deal with this complexity every day in my practice and need help!  I recommend the article by Palma in Neurology in March 2023.  Everything else is great.  The current assumption that BP measurement are not accurate is correct but the way we treat patients like they are Jabba the Hut.  Is he sitting, standing, laying down?\\n@scarab242 - I was wondering about how the MRI can give false positive in case of the thyroid. A lot of people have some kind of problem with the thyroid that can be linked to iodine deficiency. Maybe the MRI is not low-specificity, but showing something that is really there, but not classified as tumor. Dr. Brownstein writes about it more extensively, worth a check.\\n@loidepolli6132 - Interesting interview as always on this channel. I suggest Peter Attia reads Peter Singer’s book, The Untethered Soul. Do you want to learn how to be truly present and decrease misery, even happy perhaps? Read this book. The path is simple, but it’s not easy\\n@estherroberts3537 - What a brilliant mind but genius comes with challenges.  What grit to fight his own inner voice.\\n@rosa24c - wow just wow. The last 20 minutes was a master class on the vulnerability.\\n@cliftonnobles5600 - 3:19:44 I perfectly understand what Attia is saying here and it has been a crippling feature of my 37 year existence. Have been working hard at this the last 2 years and can\\'t find any peace.\\n@dialamark7863 - Thank you for the valuable information. Could you please talk about collagen and hormones in women. Thank you\\n@beefycol - Amazing. Great podcast\\n@nadabunnibun - Most important video to extend someone’s life. \\n@rktravelandinterests - Love from India to both Andrew and Peter \\n@WilliamChan - I imagine bouldering (low height rock climbing over a mat without a harness) would be great for grip and overall upper body strength, but I wonder if it\\'s also good for stability\\n@happymagoo8969 - Thank You both I think you just saved my life\\n@charulatakohli6960 - Question please. What are the pros and cons on donating blood with regards to living a longer life, well? Thank you \\n@MXF11 - It\\'s also important to look where you\\'re going to, not looking down at each step. This will help you not fall.\\n@avocadodoggo6236 - Thank you for your work\\n@jicalzad - Most doctor\\'s offices/clinics check blood pressure incorrectly, and i feel that most of those same professionals (doctors & nurses alike) know this. I think that the main issue is that it takes too much time for them, and time = $\\n@garygjl9036 - I\\'m 71, very invested in my health and fitness. My investment results are paying the best dividend possible, a happy longer life. Peter Attia talks about a measurement of fitness: grip, hanging strength. Watch \"Slava\" -Sweden\\'s got talent. Dr. Huberman inspires me equally as well. \\nI can\\'t imagine living in any other time because of the access to education about the human body. Thanks men. Merci.\\n@chrisgerard1650 - This was fantastic information\\n@davidarbelaez4395 - This is a years of life versus life in your years debate.  I’d love to live to be 100 and be both physically and cognitively vibrant up to that point.  I’m not sure how much control I have over that.\\n@OldMaid99 - Thank you, Peter! ️\\u200d\\n@paulormond1021 - For Peter - the blood pressure monitor (wrist band), is the company Aktiia? I’m using one now, for three months. Can you report your findings publicly when complete?\\nHave just pre ordered your book on audible (Thanks Andrew!).\\n@tor684 - Please do a  podcast about peptide therapy! Thank you!\\n@Maiden4eva1995 - Goldmine of awesome and interesting dialogue.\\n@ax75f92 - As a radiation therapist I find it quite impressive how well this Dr understands radiation exposure. As mentioned, by far the highest natural contributing source of radiation exposure we encounter is cosmic in origin. The 2nd highest (which wasn’t mentioned) is via natural occurring radon gas, which will vary greatly with geography. \\n@Champstarrable - Content like this restores my faith in the internet. Mahalo.\\n@saferandquieteroads - Fantastic podcast\\n@robertgzivna4702 - I still not really understand how to lower apoB(and LDL) except medicaments,please can someone tell me shortly how to do so without medicaments? I would really appreciate that\\n\\nReally thank you for this podcast, i love it!\\n@mastrorio1 - Once again, thank you for you interest in making great podcasts. Lol\\n@lisamariewurst2824 - Love all the great info but the talk about poorly done studies (I.e., hyperbaric chamber) cracked me up! \\n@susanbeever5708 - Correct Dr. Attia! This is why you are correct: The key is understanding what upregulates TRPV4 since that is what causes the break in the endothelial monolayer of the artery and it is TRPV4 that causes monocytes to become M1 macrophages and release cytokines and ROS that travel to the artery and oxidize LDL and after entering the broken monolayer of the endothelium phagocytizes the oxLDL  to become plaque! Bonus point: TRPV4 is why cells migrate/metastasize from their tissue of origin! The same cytoskeletal changes and break down of the intercellular attachments. This is all in current published research. As you see LDL get mugged by ROS as they travel through the bloodstream. ApoB is high when LDL is high to transport it.\\n@Axel-dp8uy - I would love blog articles of the takeaways from those podcast \\n@luisaparicio2583 - It\\'s very difficult to tell how much radiation a patient will be exposed to during a CT scan before the scan happens. It varies from person to person, mainly due to BMI differences. A bigger person will need a bigger dose of radiation for the same examination. So, if you want to keep radiation to a minimum when undertaking radiation based examinations just lose some weight \\n@wesleyivey9106 - @Andrew Huberman Can you give some advice for people who do not want to give up cessation, or the feeling of inhaling something like smoke or vapor? I think that\\'s the case for many smokers. They want to have a healthier option but nothing else satisfies that specific urge.\\n@martin_voxmartin - I good not imagined 15 years ago that  these information ,in many times a other side of true or reality became available  and educated us in a unprecedented way\\n@chicagoareavideos1287 - Kudos Dr Attia.\\n@kevingilhooley2064 - Don\\'t ever take a double shot of tequila for every time Peter mentions the book..that could really shorten your life.\\n@ludiabooth7718 - Wow!! Speechless. Thank you!\\n@veronicam8063 - Can you do a podcast with what supplements and food you have, the physical exercises, meditation etc. you are following at present? I think you have changed something lately, as you are looking younger\\n@lasereyesss - This is amazing!\\n@bwoodzjjb - Can I count these for college credits??? Is there a test we can take??? Wow!!! Thank you and God bless u !\\n@castorkat4868 - %50 of health and longevity is totally out of your hands and is GENETIC\\n@MariaJimenaRM - Is it possible to activate the subtitles/closed captions of this episode please? I need to share it with someone that doesn\\'t speak english and the only way to access to it in another language is through the auto-translate closed captions. \\nIf anyone knows another way to listen/read this in spanish, please let me know. Thank you!!\\n@DrewDubious - I really like this guy, 1st time listening to him.\\n@gita86 - Rightly said I don’t have to be a slave to the circumstances it is a real light bulb moment\\n@julielynn972 - Excellent video.  Thank you.\\n@aaronsteeves7976 - Question (sorry if this has been asked before) - regarding cold showers in the morning to increase dopamine. Is it OK to follow the cold shower with a a warm shower when I wake up? I think I can handle a couple minutes in the cold but Id like to follow with a warm shower for normal shower activities.\\n@luadiva - Dr Stare-into-sunrise and Dr Marginal Decade, together again! Soooo stoked.\\n@lifestylemaniacs - Amazing Podcast and people!\\n@magnusdanielsson2749 - I have an Omron machine at I get the same result from it as the manual that nurses take.\\n\\nRegarding it measuring high it do do that sometimes. To me it feels like my body gets a stress response from the compression. But if I wait a minute and do another test its much lower again.\\n@AnnKrilanovich - Thanks for insight, direction, and science.\\n@kelliez9991 - This was so very informative but I wonder why he didn’t talk about fish oil and Vascepa which are both very effective at reducing cholesterol.\\n@inthedougout301 - So, I have the apo-b mutation and next to no cholesterol.  I can\\'t find a single doctor who knows how to treat me.  I was floored to hear this stuff even mentioned given how many years I have spent trying to find folks who have even heard of my mutations.\\n@careyjamesmajeski3203 - This should be considered and balanced with lectures from Vinay prasad. He raises a number of issues relevant to dr Attia’s positions. There’s so much to learn from the disagreement between two titans.\\n@bayareamacaddict - We need Kyle Gillett and Peter and Andrew on the same podcast.\\n@TimRobertsen - Just incredible!\\n@HMohr - Really great episode, but now I\\'m afraid of all the x rays I have to do to follow my psoriatic arthritis evolution\\n@kiutpi - Prenuvo! I got my whole body MRI scan this year and I highly recommended it.\\n@dus10dnd - Holy hell... he seems to have aged super quickly within 3 months.\\n@fireman3857 - As a ex forest firefighter and 20 a day smoker. I recently quit both about a year ago. By changing jobs.\\n#1 a less stressful job\\n#2 a job close enough to home so I could run/cycle\\nAnd it worked. For me. I\\'m just hoping I did it soon enough, I will always miss the fire dept, but I want to see my kids grow up.\\n@Dusty0195 - Holy crap. I am stunned, amazed, and grateful. \\n@karisajackson1655 - This has been my favorite episode\\n@Ryan.G.Spalding - Would love to hear you all discuss HATTR Amyloidosis. They are constantly finding out a higher portion of the population have it and the first crisper study in humans was done for this disease. So there are a few interesting ways to attack the topic. Hugely responsible for the longevity difference between African Americans and other ethnicities. I think they are finding 1/3 of that population with have the disease if they live long enough.\\n@user-uj9fi3qe4k - thanks for the information . love it\\n@FootlooseFishing - It\\'s very strange, I am 23M and sure heart attacks and disease run in my family, but since I was probably 13 I have been an active runner, eating well, and sometimes would workout up to 2 hours a day; my blood pressure lately has been 160/108 consistently even on blood pressure medication and i swear the reason for that is not my diet which is not perfect or a past history of smoking briefly for 4 years (it could be adding ofcourse..) but i swear to god I was born with a speech disorder so I get paranoid and terrified about speaking to people (which is everyday) and i find that that is the reason I have high blood pressure and not because of my exercise or dieting which is like through the roof good.. so i do not understand...\\n@duncangravy6060 - This video probably saved my life. Honestly the quality of information in this is staggering.........\\n@SirGalaEd - 1:08:15 Dr. Andy Galpin will be ramping up the workouts when he hears his workouts are not as hard as Dr. Attia \\n@VincentLampone22 - Hello, can you please turn the captions on for this video? I am a deaf person and have been watching most of your videos! Love them all! Keep it up!\\n@bobc514 - You refer to \"How Not To Die\" which is the title of a great book by Dr. Michael Greger,  who would make an excellent guest to discuss nutrition.\\n@cloverl61 - Have you ever done or considered doing a podcast on how the phases of the moon affect us? Any research around that? Practical applications? Thank you.\\n@rigaleb - It is, however, so sad no one in these top rated health podcasts ever talks about autoimmune diseases. The huge number of people just barely getting by from these sinister and disabling conditions are, for now, ignored by the mainstream.\\n@rijd2304 - So many people in the West are trying to stay \"young\" but have daily practices that age them quickly: not staying hydrated, drinking alcohol, smoking, neglective whole veggies and fruits, not exercising, sitting most of the day (sometimes in the car, where the sun damages the skin through the glass), excessive caffeine (which dehydrates and causes anxiety), not getting adequate sleep, screen addiction...the list is long. The book \"30 Days to Reduce Anxiety\" by Harper Daniels helps calm the mind. Mindfulness helps a lot.\\n@karenmichaelsen4188 - Hesitant to even dive in to this podcast after watching Rich Roll interview Peter. They both were so emotional. Not sure I\\'m ready for the science. Maybe in a few weeks? Thoughts anyone? I\\'m still digesting the Rich Roll interview.\\n@perrystalsis2209 - *A Very Late Subscriber* : - But, thanks to Rogan mainly? - been dipping into this man\\'s mind-opening uploads of late.....

Nick, England.\\n@georginamanes1068 - Thank you Andrew and Peter \\n@matthewiverson46 - I would love for you to spend some time with Dr. Eric Tran and discuss his team’s groundbreaking cancer research. Their incredible work in T cell gene therapy is saving lives, and will save many more in the future. I am sure you would be very interested in Dr. Tran’s findings and the newest approach to immunotherapy, cancer studies, and working towards a cure.\\n@paullatter1604 - Other then the medical info - I like the concept that you should treat yourself as if you are your own best friend!\\n@paulajanson8053 - Yesterday, I asked my cardiologist why I have never been tested for ApbO. My total LDL is very high (familial hyperlipidemia) He said “because the treatment is the same”.  I hate doctors. We really have to do a ton of research today because we certainly can’t trust the medical establishment.\\n@justenhansen - I\\'ve only passed out one time in my life, and it\\'s while I was peeing. So I think it\\'s funny he uses that as problematic of low blood pressure.\\n@nathalisoriano5329 - Wow wow what an interview learned alot\\n@adammartinphotography - I\\'d love if you could do an episode on uric acid and long term management of hyperuricemia\\n@Ghostrider12569 - Andrew, \\nIf you recommend waiting 60-90 minutes after waking up for the intake of caffeine because of the high potential for an afternoon crash I have a question for you. Let’s say I wake up at 5am and plan on doing a 5:30am workout. But I struggle with working out during this time if I don’t have pre-workout because I still feel half asleep. What is something I can do to find energy during a early morning workout in order to postpone caffeine intake for the day?? Thank you!\\n@marthaolkhova9581 - Hi, my favorite channel here on YouTube. \\n\\nCould you please share best knowledge on how to feed the body while being sick. I normally eat low carb and practice IF , but some say one has to feed body more often and higher calories. They even give you carb loaded \\'vitamin\\' teas.... \\n@bibingus23 - Great and informative. Only criticism is that Dr Attia misspoke about Fentanyl dosing he was off by a factor of 10. 1mg fentanyl about equal to 10 mg of morphine, so he likely got 100 mcg and not 1 mg after surgery\\n - you could definitely do 3 hours on Presence and Attention... very rare traits these days.\\n@AXELMARTIINA - Marvelous guest and interviewer\\n@GrooveSchoolRecs - Thank you gentlemen for this information  BLESSINGS\\n@taylorleatherman5781 - Hi there, I\\'m here to ask a question. I have asthma, and I\\'m discovering that it may be  psychological. Do you have any information on psychosomatic asthma?\\n@swaha55 - I learn a lot from your podcasts. Thank you. \\nI noticed you have stopped promoting Thorne products and now are promoting Momentous products. Do you feel that Momentous is a lot better than Thorne? They don\\'t have as many products\\n@lisigetbusy - Did you discuss how to lower apoB by nutrition? I guess I missed that cause I thought lowering saturated fats are causing peeks?\\n@1dosstx - Hey guys, can you please enable caption transcripts? I like to compile this information for my own notes and education. Thank you.\\n@johnjamesmckeogh2388 - What are the places Dr. Attia went for his advance therapy? Which one did he find the best?\\n@nomeda1071 - Incredible. Gold handed out to anyone who wants it.\\n@matshallgren3383 - Great discussion but I thought a couple of things could have been mentioned during the discussion around statins. First, statin side effects are enormously under reported, both by patients and physicians. Many of the less common yet debilitating side effects were not mentioned. Second, neither of the discussants mentioned that its possible to have a DNA test to determine whether you are likely to have an adverse reaction to different types of statin medications. This can be enormously helpful and potentially prevent someone who cannot metabolize statins from taking them and suffering short or long term side effects that can impact life quality.\\n@AR-ne1xb - Great interview as always! Regarding liking the taste of wine tequila etc; why not put it in your mouth and spit it out? Does this decrease the disadvantages a lot?\\n@yaslh3534 - Pure gold.\\n@CatherineMcCune - About the scanning: I participate in medical research and was told that the CT scan would be equivalent to one year of “regular living” on the earth. Is that incorrect or does it depend on what area is being screened?\\n@LesleyPeach - Do either of you think that the inner rage created in your (Dr Attia) formative years has anything to do with your genetics, specifically the Apo protein? Does the change in mental approach correlate with the physical at all?\\n@karenmichaelsen4188 - This is beautiful. Simply beautiful. 2 beautiful souls.\\n@funafterfifty7833 - Thank you so much !\\n@courtneymoline4936 - In the hospital we give micrograms (mcg) of Fentanyl. 50-100mcg would be a typical one time dose for an average size/age human. It has a short half-life so we might give more within an hour depending on the injury of the patient. So when he said he got some in the hospital, he would have received 100mcg not mg. That’s why 1mg is killing people.\\n@jklumel - Awesome talk. There will be more episodes with Dr. Peter Attia, for sure. Always interesting when both experts meet.\\n\\nFrom a cancer specialist I expected that Dr.Attia shall broaden an insight on ethanol use since Professor Huberman focuses only on enteral use, where science is quite settled and clear. But the enteral use of ethanol is erroneous application of this potent molecule for any health gains, while parenteral use offers so much effective, safe and inexpensive benefits (some still unexplored) from simple epidermal antimicrobial effects to ethanol ablation therapies for cancer treatment.\\n@williamleal6363 - Hey, i just want to say ... i said the same thing at 49:18. Fascinating indeed!\\n@subzero8047 - been listening for 2 hours and finally made it to the 20\\nminute mark \\n\\njj \\n@healthyfunkyfree - When using medication to lower apo B particles - is this for a period of time until numbers hit the suggested 20-30 mg/dl and then better control with diet or is it a lifelong prescription.\\n@dirtydiana8434 - Wow I have a similar practice when it comes to my temper that I sometimes lash out at my poor mother that I take care of and sounds cruel being that she suffers from dementia making it  very difficult for me at times, one of the things that I\\'ve done is tell her, \" oh I\\'m not talking to you I\\'m talking to the person that\\'s sitting next to you,\" if she has imaginary people in her life I think that I pretend like there\\'s someone there sitting next to her and she understands that talk so she knows that I wasn\\'t yelling at her that I was yelling at the person next to her anyway it\\'s similar but thank you for this wonderful podcast I got so much out of it and I look forward to more of your interviews with these highly educated experts\\n@chadbailey3623 - On the neurodegenerative diseases, couldn’t it be that the things we can detect like amyloid plaque in Alzheimer’s and repeat expansion proteins in Huntington’s represent a defect in an underlying mechanism, such as autophagy or apoptosis?\\n@hotmarry4584 - I wish such guys like you would be in politics, the world would be much better place to live!!!\\n@gwiz7746 - Some good information here but I think the section on fall risk misses the mark. Suggesting that using box step-ups as a prescription for avoiding falls is to implies we only fall moving forward. Step ups are an exercise limited to the sagittal plane (front to back) of movement. Ignoring exercise that strengthens in the frontal plane (side-to-side) movement would be a more complete way to work toward avoiding a hip fracture. Falling toward your side is more likely how your hip gets broken. Most people are far weaker in the frontal plane than sagittal plane of motion. Try doing a few unweighted Cossack squats and any weakness and lack of flexibility in that plane will be readily apparent. I would also add backwards walking as a means (that was clinically documented) of both improving balance and increasing your life span.\\n@pranzata - I tried to vape to quit smoking cigarettes, and in my opinion it was way worse… because there is no smell and you can smoke it indoors, I smoked it all the time, and far more than I smoked cigarettes. Within just a few weeks my lungs hurt in a way that I’ve never felt before after vaping.\\n@leticiaamorim2739 - Amazing. You 2 are the best.\\nAndrew, I would love to see you interview Gabor Mate.\\n@reneecaines9097 - MACE. That\\'s interesting that it doesn\\'t register until 40. My dad (alcoholic, heavy smoker, stress case) had his first heart attack at age 36. After his 4th one he now has 8 ste 58:07 nts holding his heart open. He did quit smoking after the first one, but the damage was done. His heart had major damage. His last known one, we found out he was sneaking a few smokes here and there. Some people refuse to learn.\\n@robgentry3472 - Peter mentions his wife is a nurse.

I used to think that referring to LDL as \"bad\" was an over-simplication, but it sounds like that\\'s correct. \\n@Niglaz303 - You mentioned when wer\\'re in a stress situation we utilize a lot of cholesterol to create energy (if i recall correctly). Is this the underlying mechanism for hormonal imbalances and, say, for example, low sex drive in chronically stressed individuals as a consequence of chronically low cholesterol levels? Or am I oversimplifying the matter and if so what are the mechanisms for this health outcome? Thanks!\\n@MsChristina53 - Would hyperbaric treatment have any benefit for a child with a brain injury that happened in utero or at birth?

It was harder to follow than normally, more abbreviations and terms which weren\\'t explained.\\n2. Last part was not science-based, but a personal story.

Because if someone don’t really care for you all they have to do is call on a particular stylist who’s been in business between 5-3 decades. But At first I thought I was just being Paranoid about Blondie. But I’ve been counting all the people she been clothing for Photo shoots and special events who windup with that disease. But I just might be over thinking because I am almost 25% British.\\n@raiderkeno - I think the argument for alcohol vs cannabis. Is that alcohol is far more worst when it comes to things like, domestic violence, drinking and driving, family abuse, dealing with belligerent people, being able to hold a job.

I\\'m a guy in my 30\\'s and I\\'ve decided I wanna take Attias advice and gain more muscle. Which I\\'ve always believed means you gotta be in a calorie surplus. This to me seems completely contrary to his emphasis on calorie restriction though. Is being in a surplus ok? I ain\\'t talking bulking but a small surplus. Also does it matter too much what form the calories come in? I aim to eat mostly whole food but sometimes If I\\'ve taken the recommended protein intake I might grab the odd chocolate bar to notch my calorie up to my target.\\n@n2daair23 - Just wondering what TYPE of therapist y’all are talking about?

Question:  Can we simply relate causality to carbs as they convert to sugar and IR?  Seems like the carbs sink the cargo ships.  Switch to Quinoa due to grains being harmful to humans (only introduced to humans 10,000 yrs ago and thus not normal for our bodies)?  We\\'ve eaten meat and veggies a lot longer.  Focus primarily on meat, vege\\'s & quinoa?  Anyone remember a lecture in SF by a high level & successful M&A man out of the east coast who was diagnosed to die by 40?  He found this out at 39 and did not accept this so he quit his high stressed job and then researched everything about causality and nutrition.

Since you unofficially titled this talk \"How Not To Die,\" I\\'m wondering if you could in a future episode address the book with the same title, literally \"How Not to Die,\" by Michael Greger MD. This book has gained almost cult-like popularity with my mother and an alarming number of her peers of the same generation, who are echoing the claims of this book far and wide, which are basically that to avoid severe degeneration of heart, brain and general health, you must stop eating all animal products of any kind forever. Since this did not make Dr. Attia\\'s list, can you speak to why not and why this book is gaining such a following? I\\'d love to have some ammunition next time I speak with one of the cult members (assuming they\\'re wrong). If they\\'re not wrong, then I\\'ll have to jump on the bandwagon! But I would really rather not without really solid evidence!\\n@lorenzohot5234 - Got the book!\\n@massouji - Thank you for a fantastic pod mr Huberman! There is one thing that bugs me though. You mention the dangers of vaping cannabis, as you did in your episode dedicated to cannabis. But in both instances you talk about so-called e-cigarettes, and the adverse health effects to the lungs when using these devices seems to be caused by the additive chemicals like vitamin E acetate, which is used to dilute the THC. Aren\\'t these studies thus flawed? The negative effects shown in these studies are side-effects of the delivery device, not vaping per se. In order to see the effects of vaping cannabis, one should use devices like the Volcano or the Mighty or numerous other convection or conduction vaporizers that only heat up the cannabis flower to a certain degree, without adding any additives whatsoever. The only studies that I can find that uses these delivery methods are not very recent, and they all report positive results when it comes to adverse effects on the lungs, when compared to regular smoking. Am I missing something?\\n@mattgraves3709 - I pre-ordered Peter\\'s book.\\n@hoganfan924 - Tough to determine an equivalency between pot and tobacco smoking. Pot smoking deposits about 4X the amount of tar, as tobacco into the lungs. The tar must have long term health effects, besides the 30-some carcinogenic compounds in pot.\\n@Lkucho - It\\'s a good talk, except somewhat too technical. I don\\'t know if this is for an average audience. I believe that simplicity es very important, I don\\'t know if so much info about longevity is necessary for the regular person. Basically longer life in its basic practice just requires good nutrition, eat food that come from the earth, walk about an hour a day and drink plenty of water., patience, forgiveness, and great fullness.\\n@carolr.556 - Is there any other way to screen the lungs without CT scan?\\n@stephben8042 - One of the best ways to not die you’d think is to avoid the global pandemic which is causing cardiovascular immunomodulatory disease.

Anyone who has had any patch of poor emotional health in their lives know that there is no separation between physical and emotional health. We are one, whole creature. Everything affects everything.  Adrenalin is proof of emotional responses directly changing the chemistry of the body. So is dopamine, serotonin and all the others.

So, they can have completely different lipid models. 2, In most populations with a “standard American diet”, a high ApoB/LDL level is usually a result of a high carb/sugar diet and insulin resistance. So, it’s a highly correlated symptom but not the root cause. My 2 cents.\\n@mikefaber3567 - Unfortunately I do understand the part at the end in every way. I understand how he can\\'t communicate it.

I\\'m not sure that i heard anything over the course of the discussion with respect to addressing high ApoB other than the only way to improve lipids and specifically a \"high ApoB\" value is pharmacotherapy.  Is this Peter\\'s position?  how should someone in their mid 40s that is checking the right boxes, diet, regular exercise etc. but still has high ApoB and perhaps LDL and HDL slightly outside of the reference ranges handle this?\\n@joshhead9368 - I can assure you that hardhats make a very bug difference.

I have both knees bad from arthritis and previous rotator cuff injury. Exercise so hard and almost 70. What kind of exercise would you do? Anyone?\\n@IvicaOS - @Andrew Huberman for the life of me I can\\'t understand 38:30 how lipoprotein being water soluble, as oppose to lipid on it’s own not being water soluble, operates as a vehicle for lipid via plasma that is water because if outer shell of lipoprotein (that is protein, and lipid is core) executes it\\'s function and that is - dissolves in water, wouldn\\'t that leave that core lipid exposed in a blood/plasma stream? If it, that protein outer shell of lipoprotein, in fact does not dissolve in water - how is it then water soluble and key factor of transporting lipid through the blood stream with that water solubility properties? how can anything that dissolves in some solvent be a vehicle for something? \\n@BeyondJustTheFacts - The data research conundrum really bothers me as only about 3% of people in the US have no measurable metabolic disease and less then 0.1 % of these people are doing Keto/Paleo/High Intensity Exercise and we have almost no short term let alone long term data on these people.  How does any of this fantastic really import data apply to me ??\\n@SunSandAndSea - Sounds like APOa & APOb should be ordered with every yearly physical. Even if your lipids are all normal. BUT i bet my doctor will pushback when i ask him.\\n@jimk5307 - First, great interview and information for the majority of the conversation and learning here.  Kudos!!   However, really?   Comment about hard hats “hard hats don’t protect against anything”   I feel like that degrades your reputation, but would like to learn if there is more to understand.  Do you have a study to show that comment has merit?  They won’t stop a steel beam from hurting you just like a steel toed shoe won’t protect you from a lift-truck driving over your foot. But a small falling object (a nut, maybe even a hammer or screwdriver for example) from a height, will do a lot of damage to your head.  Objects dropped from on high is a big deal and hard hats do help from my understanding.\\n@robertstout7756 - How would you rate Thai Chi in this aging equation?\\n@steelcash - This is a great watch. That said, Attia saying that Cannabis is every bit as harmful as cigarettes is utterly absurd. Huberman went on to compare alcohol and Cannabis to being hit by a bus or a motorcycle. Again, this is absurd. Every bit of scientific data that we have indicates that Cannabis is clearly and unequivocally safer than both cigarettes and alcohol, and indeed are not comparable. It’s analogous to comparing a deep fried chunk of fat to a fresh garden salad.\\n@achiu23 - Dr. Huberman, \\nI have been a fan and listen to every single episode of the podcast since start.  Thank you for everything you do.  \\nHowever, the fact that you are advocating to avoid dental X-rays shows how little you know regarding such subject.  You have mentioned previously in one of the past episodes to avoid dental X-rays. Dental professionals HAVE to hide behind the walls because they have to take multiple X-rays a day for patients.  Whereas you occasionally are exposed to two to four X-rays a year to two years.  So we have to protect ourselves from accidentally being exposed unnecessarily 20 times a day. \\n@dizzy7158 - Are 7 eggs in one day bad for you? (I’m just curious what people say, as I seem to find various answers online)\\n@westfield90 - I think more than anything it is diet, a sedentary lifestyle and the increased level of mental stress in modern societies is what kills people early. When you look at ww2 generation, many of them lived into their 80’s while they smoked incessantly and ate a diet consisting of meat. The difference is the food wasn’t processed as today’s food is and I don’t believe they snacked constantly on chips, candies, yogurts, snacks as we tend to do today. Plus since life was difficult with many challenges, people had a maturity to accept difficulties. Today’s generations are overly sensitive, overly delicate that even a thumbs down on their YouTube video depresses and results in an all night ice cream binge.

A joint tend to have no or propper filter. Also joint often tend to be mixture of cannabis and tobacco. From my personal experience, I was coughing after smoking 5 joints as much as if I smoked pack of ciggeretes. In my humble opinion a joint is way more harmful to lungs than ciggarete is. However I don\\'t know that it is worse for high blood pressure. I was a tobbaco smoker for years and had way too high blood pressure. Then I quit ciggaretes for good but became chronic weed smoker. Didn\\'t feel that my blood pressure is that high but it was certainly higher than now when I don\\'t smoke.\\n@DiegoDrum21 - I wonder why there was no discussion about what actually causes high APOB or high LDL and only discussed medical interventions?\\n@MarissaCarterArtist - I always find it ironic that everyone dismembers cholesterol and choline yet why have an engine without a car on a road?

Why is everyone like this?\\n@mmmhmmmk - As a scientist who has studied measuring ionizing radiation, no offense Peter, but I would say you don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. The NRC limit is twice what you said it is, and that limit was purposely set to be well below where there is any quantifiable effect.

But when it comes to smoking it sounds like both of you are inexperienced on the subject and so most of what you are saying is hearsay or speculation. Smoking isn\\'t good for you period, yeah we got that, but neither is shutting people out of an entire society and economy and expect them not to double down on a habit that fills their need of mental or physical stimulus that working or problem solving in the work place could provide if they weren\\'t down on their luck artificially at the behest of others who dont consider their perspectives.\\n@tomdirks7236 - Great content, but I have to take exception to Peter\\'s comments about particulate air pollution being responsible for \"levels of magnitude more deaths than CO2 will ever be.\" That statement shows a lack of knowledge about the long-term potential consequences of climate change if we don\\'t adopt immediate measures to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Peter is very knowledgeable about his area of expertise, but that knowledge obviously doesn\\'t extend to climate science.

But as someone who has been on the receiving end of such behaviour from a parent, I can say that \"making amends\" is small consolation to the victims and, at best, a half-measure. The real solution is to stop engaging in violence (whether emotional or physical) in the first place. Until he achieves that, his \"vulnerability\" in talking about his victimisation of others rings hollow.\\n@TheNalimo - Lets compliment Peter for his complete inability to understand that the audience are NOT medical doctors and do not match his medical vocabulary.

This is a MASSIVE grey area - as what the mainstream considers to be \"vaping\" involves cheap chemically infused and flavoured vapes. A connoisseur however would be more inclined to smoke in a MUCH healthier way perhaps using a convexion vape such as the classic Volcano at home (heating their cannabis without burning and also without any tobacco and, if you source some good organic cannabis, without extra chemicals). I actually met someone with chronic asthma who smoked  marihuana at home using the volcano without any reported asthma related ill effects. I believe if you are willing to splash out you can also get a decent portable convexion vape which I believe in itself is healthier than using a conduction vape. The short of this is that VAPING cannot be used as a blanket term when talking about any potential health effects.\\n@mosin9105 - Thank you\\n@mosin9105 - Thank you\\n@gosias1983 - Just to refer to  02h55m  , is David Sinclair less anxious because of contemplating mortality daily?\\n@otis8166 - Ending is 11/10\\n@danyanani9769 - 1:31:16 What are your vices?

This is such a controversial subject in terms of root cause and reversal/treatment (ex.

It may be a distraction from finding the reason why it build up in the first place. It\\'s often about unmet expectations. The question is whether they are rational or not. If they appear rational: do other people share this thought? If yes, are they honest or polite? And honestly: if you optimise the s out of your life and see the deadline of life in front of you constantly, you sure put a lot of pressure to be doing the rationally best without compromise. That doesn\\'t sound healthy either to me... more  like something that imposes someone\\'s will onto yourself, maybe because you don\\'t quite know/believe in what you want yourself..?

I subscribe to scurvy theory, but you did not mention it, or other root cause. So I am interested in your view - why us? Scurvy theory says the root cause of arteriosclerosis is humans inability to synthesis vitamin C. I read humans lost this ability 40 million years ago and Lassie didn\\'t. To make collagen you need vitamin C (and protein). Colligan is a key structural component of arteries. No collagen = leaking arteries = scurvy = death. What does the body have to hand to patch leaking arteries? Cholesterol, which is a building block of cells, so an easy evolutionary pathway. I have a paper somewhere that says particles specifically pass through the intima to the media, performing this patch up job. This explains why people with genetics from Northern Europe have worse problems with arteriosclerosis that those with tropical genetics - living through a winter on dried fish is going to give you scurvy for sure. Once the body has a patching cholesterol hammer every arterial injury looks like a nail.\\n@angelosenteio - Whats with all the data that says treating high cholesterol with medication has little no effect on health outcomes?\\n@isaarunarom7830 - Decided on st patties day if I drink it must be in the first 3 hours of being awake Soni can sleep sober\\n@visnjabalonski336 - Whole food plant based is the future\\n@jacobrosemeier8650 - What is Dr. Attia drinking during this?\\n@stormo666 - What’s Peter drinking out of the mason jar?\\n@sebastiantotte3329 - Thanks\\n@OverJam52 - In France, cancer is the number one killer, and CVD only comes in second position.

Thank you for your creations.\\n@mireyarose15 - I just had a crazy out of body experience falling asleep to this. It was almost scary because I thought I was passing away. I was lifted upwards out of my body slightly toward what to me was the light, it looked like my ceiling had an opening where there were clouds and orange peeking through very similar to a sunset and I could hear a man humming in a similar tone to this music. I was scared to go further so I grabbed to the side of me to hold onto my sheets and grabbed a book. The book grounded me but when I tried to look at the book to see what book it was I couldn’t see it because it was invisible and then I was even more scared so I tried my best to wake up from this state by jolting my head a bit and then I woke up but there is no book beside me. Glad to be back.\\n@beyoumeditationmusic - Deep at the center of our being there is an infinite \"Well of Love\", allow this love now to flow freely throughout your whole being and fill your heart, body, mind and soul...allow healing to happen... peace and blessing to all of you \\n@unkxwnmopar2214 - Played this while I was reading and my girlfriend was asleep.

And if it’s not okay, it’s not the end. You’re still going thru it, and you will know when you get there, because you’re going to be okay. “ it was a long process, but dang if she wasn’t right… and everytime it was far from ok, I’d tell myself, “it’s not the end then. This isn’t how this chapter ends. Because it’s not okay yet”…. And when that very difficult chapter came to a close, everything was okay… in fact it was better than okay.

I’m trying so damned hard to dig myself out of this pit that I’ve fallen in. And worst of all it’s not even a mental battle, to me it’s worse cause it’s something I don’t necessarily have total control over, it’s financial…. It’s so materialistic it hurts my soul knowing how stressed I get not sure if I’m gonna be able to afford groceries this paycheck or if I gotta balance it amongst bills.

Mantra is a form of pagan prayer directed to the Universe, Nature or to pagan Deities, Shiva, Krishna, etc.\\nIf you are a Christian or a Muslim and practice Vedic practices, then you may already have left your religion!\\nYogic practices, apart from physical exercises, are aimed at identification with the Universe, Cosmos, Existence, merging with it! At the moment of merger, a person passes from the Particular into the One, Consciousness passes into the Awareness of this Unity, this is the moment of death of the Personality! Spiritual death occurs, because in the One there is no Particular, there is no Personality, there is no Soul!\\n@gghmoney - Anyone else used to Astro project while numb in the dentist chair\\n@Kaitlynlovem - Harmony \\n@johnnycalories6500 - Ok  so nice to sleep with!!

No one comes to God but by him and by his precious blood which was shed for all our sins when He was crucified. Heaven and hell are real places and there are countless testimonials of people who have had near death experiences that witnessed them firsthand. The bible is a real book. Everyone shall be judged by their hearts and actions in this life. Only Jesus is able to set you free from your sins. The time is very short. You have been warned.

I am a 52 yo man that got sober after a lifetime of alcohol and drug abuse and I was a smoker. Came totally clean December 2020. Completely turned my life around. 2 months ago I started a simple workout routine after reading “Can’t hurt Me” by David Goggins. Your routine is one to aim for. The beautiful thing about the podcast is your choice of topics that are so beneficial to a guy like me. I had already read Dr Anna Lembke’s book, “Dopamine Nation” and consumed dozens of hours listening to Dr Jordan Peterson…and there you all are…top of the elite list of massively influential players driving me to be a better person spiritually, mentally, physically and emotionally. Thank you for putting this information together in a way I can chew and benefit from to hopefully share with others. Thank you again!\\n@Simmol3 - My notes:\\n\\nIf having to sit at a desk for long period of time do soleus pushups. This is done by having your feet flat on the floor, lifting the heel to top of range of motion and lowering. This uses your soleus muscle which is designed to handle walking all day. Shown to cause over 50% improvements in glucose management after eating. \\n@shanbug6174 - I honestly can’t think of any other person or resource who has contributed so greatly to my health, happiness, and wellbeing. In this swarm of information we live in, social media, influencer bullshit, constantly being “sold to”, it is so so so meaningful to have access to quality information that has real impacts on my health and relationships.

I appreciate this window into your health journey and your n of 1 experiences. Your content is really accessible.

Thank you! \\n@blessedpeople1741 - Dr. Huberman I want to thank you a lot for this great lecture about overall fitness standards.

I often find myself trying to find which episode I heard you mention a supplement and tools. Just a thought. Thanks for everything you do for us. and thanks for supporting our interest in science. \\n@seandenny9839 - Love the podcast and everything about it. I have a topic suggestion. Pain. You mentioned it in one episode so I\\'m sure it\\'s on your radar but as a physical therapist acute/chronic pain is almost universally misunderstood and is a huge problem in our lives. I do a lot of education about it and I find it very interesting. I enjoy Adrian Louw\\'s work, but I confess I have not looked heavily into the research for other suggestions.\\n@cdrew2 - It\\'s incredible that this up-to-date science-backed information on health & fitness is available to us content consumers at no upfront cost. An excellent, easy to understand analysis and summarization of complex research, I will not take this podcast for granted. Thank you Dr. Huberman, your work is an honest service to those trying to better themselves.\\n@konradnoises - Great info, very detailed. I do believe that a lot of listeners would benefit from seeing the actual routine of your exercises, and could come with great engagement.\\n@cmauro6827 - Many years ago at a presentation by a group of ADHD adults, the Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups were recommended to get rid of that \"antsy\" feeling of excess energy.  Thanks for the program for the week, it is very well thought out.  The Stretching too, is a nice finishing touch to any workout. Thanks for all this info.  I had only 4 hours sleep last night, and I now will go out and workout anyways !  Mind you, Saturdays is upper body, so, no brainer.  :)\\n@tammymc37 - Wow!  Thank you for this!  I have never had a template for fitness period!  But to find one that I can adapt to my fitness level is just amazing.  It allowed me to move forward.  I\\'m 59 years old, and obviously can\\'t do the same level of workout you can...but I search for beginner leg workout, beginner HIIT.  I can find the template exercises at my own level.  But what helps me is to have an outline of how to get the whole body fit.  I really appreciate this!\\n@GallantryX - Excellent podcast like always Andrew, the biggest takeaway from me was the Exercise schedule overall, I would say it’s designed perfectly, I’ve always wanted to exercise and build muscle as well as still improve my cardiovascular health overall, Well done!\\n@carolinelewis952 - Thank you so much for this!

Like a 2 week plan?\\n@hannahlibby991 - Love your podcast!\\nYou mention keeping your workouts to around an hour due to the spike in cortisol after that amount of time, do you have links to studies that back this up? Thanks!\\n@scottyg5403 - I enjoy your podcast but I have to admit that the fitness related Conversations are definitely my favorite! I am an older athlete and I\\'ve been working out for many years so anything new that I can add to my toolbox to improve my overall fitness is welcome ! Thanks again!\\n@marelizemaritz1398 - As a physiotherapist, I like to vary the types of exercises e.g. for legs I will do back squats, sumo squats, narrow squats, front squats etc. To keep challenging my muscle groups and also improving mobility in them. However, I understand if one\\'s aim is to get muscle hypertrophy, sticking to those specific exercises that work for you, that\\'s fine.\\n@MarkYaman - Hi Andrew , love your stuff . I wanted to ask you something , I love watching your videos specially based around testosterone and fitness .\\nWatching your stuff , it has been easy for me to be tempted into taking all the possible natural supplements possible , but I wanted to ask is there any negative effects that are possible from overdoing it .\\n@trentonthomas3127 - Thank you so much you\\'ve really helped me alot with your podcasts and helped me correct alot of my bad habits from alcohol to fitness to weed and sleep all have had a positive impact on my life and without someone like you I\\'d still be uninformed and unmotivated withering away from shift work feeling worse each day but you\\'ve helped shine a light on me and I make sure to try and pass that torch to all my friends and family \\n@quaketheduck1247 - Thank you for sharing your knowledge and motivation me.\\nI have had severe muscle spasms in my back that would occur at random.

Thanks\\n@richedwards9292 - Hi Dr. Huberman and thank you for providing us with such tremendously useful content.        In your leg resistance training day, do you place any emphasis on glute development?          You should consider having Brett Contreras, PhD as a guest on your show.\\n@ZackCoy-jr6me - I love the protocol! Does it change at all if I add skill work. For example, I\\'m trying to train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu 2-3 times per week. Can I just pile that on top of the schedule you shared with us?\\n@alicelopes6698 - as a person who lives with dermatillomania (skin picking) for more than a decade, I would love to see a episode about dermatillomania and other types of repetitive behaviors and how to overcome them!! love the podcast \\n@gailmartindale - My favorite podcast by far.

I really appreciate all of the information that you share on your podcasts, the guests you have, the questions you ask the explanations of the scientific studies are all just perfect.  thank you, thank you, thank you!\\n@jamiecrump8979 - Thanks for giving me what I need at the time I\\'m looking for it!! You blow my mind brother!\\nI was recently considering how I could optimally train in the sense of \"if $#it hits the fan, what kind of strength and fitness would serve me and my family best\"\\nI believe this protocol covers all bases for this line of thought and creates great habits and keeps it simple.  \\n@allangraham3649 - Thanks for your time and thanks to all involved in producing these. Peace\\n@Joy80JJ - Great info as I just stated lifiting about 2 yrs ago after losing 80lbs in 2020...by the way in my 60\\'s. Never felt so strong and awesome. Thank you Andrew.\\n@GayatriTirumalasetty - Thanks for this Andrew, and for all the hard work. Could there be a part 2 of this \\'optimal protocol\\', focusing on some possible modification in protocols or addition of new ones for female physiology? Perhaps keeping in mind female hormone cycle and how to leverage from different phases for better training? I\\'d really love for you to make content focusing on female physiology in particular. As I heard from Dr. Peter Attia\\'s episode, where he made some strong statements on the lack of enough research on female health and as general public, we\\'re not very informed about hormone regulation and leveraging it for our benefit. I hope this gets your attention. Thank you for initiating interest in science!\\n@fahada1921 - Man this is fantastic. Can’t thank you enough.\\n@allfusionx - What a treat! Thank you Dr. Huberman. “Flexibility” topic came up pretty late in the game. Overall great to see/hear the broad coverage. Made me realize I don’t have enough cardio in my current protocol\\n@melissaenslin4 - Thank you, Dr Huberman. Your channel is a diamond in the sea of noise. I jump between extremes: either, don\\'t do anything, or overtrain. This protocol is going to help me structure my training into something that can turn into a long term habits. So many training programs out there never seem to hit the sweet spot. They either are too difficult, too focused on one aspect of training, or just don\\'t really do anything (if I never see donkey kicks again, I won\\'t be sad).  I am working on ramping up fitness for a 2 week hiking expedition across Tanzania and Kilimanjaro. Will use this as a base, incorporate Wim Hoff breathing and obviously build up duration (and elevation) of my hikes closer I get to the expedition date.\\n@aler8910 - Very awaited fitness series and can’t wait for the fat loss episode! \\n\\nI was also wanted to know if the same type of “all around” training program could be applied to a year. Let’s say in a year time every 4 month we shift our priority in the following fashion:\\n@bharathsf - Just when I was thinking how on earth can I balance work with my fitness aim, Dr. Andrew comes up with this gem. Thanks a lot. This along with Dr Rangan Chatterjee is helping me a lot\\n@zechariahthompson741 - Thanks for the great info! How long is the session of High Intensity Cardio on Friday’s?\\n@freedomiseffortless - Thanks so much for your podcast Dr Huberman - it\\'s really constructive and helpful and really appreciate all the work you put it to make it freely available.\\n@adriangroborz3584 - Great podcast!! Super informative, very well explained, simply the best ! thank you !!\\n@lindsayhaskins2848 - Thank you for another fantastic episode !\\n..although I did learn from Ido Portal, I wonder if you would consider interviewing Naudi Agular, his perspective on functional movements and correcting people\\'s movement issues is pretty incredible!\\n@garethmiguel - Great stuff: it\\'s nice to see a lot of the elements you\\'ve previously discussed laid out in a useable, versatile manner.\\n@nicolesalgadocortes3930 - Hi Andrew! Thank you very much for these toolkits PURE GOLD! I am eagerly waiting for the one for chronic pain.\\n@AwareParenting - Love love love all of this. I\\'ve been trying to piece things together with all the amazing advice and this is exactly what I\\'ve been needing. Thank you! P.s. Long endurance workouts were long walks with the baby in a carrier over several years. Nature\\'s own progressive overload... Ditch the pram people.\\n@kmichalene - Fantastic podcast! Thank you for this foundational approach to fitness. Always a pleasure!\\n@bonitaderosa643 - Just absolutely love your channel. Thanks so much for my education in science:) Any advice you can share about how to manage the brain when you\\'re 65 plus - not me, but a dear friend who seems to feel like it\\'s \"all over now\" since he can\\'t do as much physically as he used to:(   Such wonderful work you\\'re doing for so many of us who did not go to Stanford:)\\n@theeprincess777 - Love these podcasts. Maybe I missed it but I wish you would do home workouts. I live rural and am gone 12 hours a day to and from work. I have a treadmill and a rower but would like modifications for workouts that replace machines.  This is true for many people who live out of a city environment Thank you\\n@artheaterapias - I really needed this explanation, I\\'ve been trying to organize my week and exercises for a while, but there\\'s so much loose information that it\\'s hard to compile! Thank you very much!\\n@_juliusgabriel - Thank you, Dr.Huberman for the great work and generosity! I hope you find this comment so people who needs a tracker in following your protocol can also use what I have created for myself (which is very valuable!). I created a workout tracker inspired by this fitness protocol that can help monitor the daily workouts and routines. ALSO, the template is customizable and free for everyone \\n@caseyvalentinelli5761 - Hi!  Loved this episode. I have 2 questions.  I’ve been considering buying a rowing machine.  Could I row on all the days?  Just something light on the not focused cardio days?   And on the hot/cold days can I start and end on hot or should I end on cold and then go about my day.  Thank you!\\n@mdnelson2007 - Thank you Dr. Huberman and the podcast team for everything you all do. This podcast has changed my life. I feel more healthier overall and have the knowledge to back up my choices. I appreciate it so much!\\n@outdoortribe.slovenia - Let me first say I love Huberman Lab podcast. Amazing info and great value to anyone willing to learn!\\n\\nThe workout plan you describe in this episode seems to be very well thought trough. However, I believe there is one crucial component that is missing and that is agility. If I am not mistaken you have touched this subject briefly in the episode with Jeff Cavaliere. My belief is that developing and maintaining agility by practicing sports like basketball, volleyball, soccer, kickboxing, etc. is of high importance. This can count as your cardio workout, either mild or high intensity. I would love to hear your thoughts on how important (or unimportant) do you believe to be to work on your agility and what the best approach would be.\\n@stephendownie3539 - What advice can you offer for us oldies getting back into fitness training? Thanks for your work.\\n@barisarat - Amazing episode! Please consider doing another episode on sports related injury recovery protocol and mechanisms.\\n@anthonymyers4516 - A neurobiologist talking about his ideas on complete body health...exactly what a very young, mild epileptic needs to hear to help understand everyday physical health, and limits. Always looking forward to a majority of your uploads.\\n@ivaivanova4190 - Dear Andrew, \\n\\nCan you recommend a resource for devising an exercise schedule for a 79-year-old male with two hip replacements, and back and knee problems - (cardio is especially tricky)? (And, of course, for anyone else that identifies with this description.)\\n@alikanbar9477 - I think making an episode covering tools and exercices a person can do to increase his IQ or something like that would be really great.\\n+ such a great episode useful information\\n@catherinerossba-fineartma-6619 - Great to see you and to be able to learn from you here … thank you >>> this is a great topic—especially because your able to Synthesize the best of what you spoke about in you the fantastic interviewing episodes with the many wonderful guests … it’s fantastic have the privilege to have this opportunity to listen to you articulate your concept of using a template to help us use the best protocols and precisely how we can integrate the best  practices to create our own customized fitness program by using your template and the best practices to improve overall health.\\n@AwidVahedi - How is so much knowledge for free? Love the amount of value you deliver with that depth of explanation! Thank you \\n@dr.joelm.rothaizermcc4222 - I love your podcast. I\\'ve learned a huge amount that I apply to my life. I share it extensively with friends and clients, and I signed up for the premium channel. All that said, I felt like this episode was too Andrew-centered. I\\'m an almost-70 y/o. I\\'m a distance runner (30 marathons+ in the last 26 years) and I lift weights. I don\\'t know that I\\'ve ever heard you talk about how protocols need to be modified at different age ranges, and in this episode you\\'re not speaking to distance runners at all.\\n@xDarcade - Thank you so much for your effort providing those informations!\\n@katherine2397 - Hi Andrew, do you think you could do a podcast on what women experience throughout the different phases of their menstrual cycles and tools to best combat some of the more unpleasant symptoms women have to deal with? As a woman, my changing hormone levels throughout my cycle play a huge role in my mental health and productivity and I\\'d like to learn about how I can better regulate these changes.\\n@timotheegermes468 - Anyone know if switching Day 2 with Day 3 would have any negative impacts? Personally I would have way to much muscle ache from the endurance day to straight go to leg hypertrophy the following day\\n@JohnShepardTIOTR - Greetings Dr. Quick question for you on this protocol. If one were doing skill learning as part of this regimen (like golf), how/where would you recommend adding in the skill portion of this?\\n@katrinafleming4991 - Brilliant resource. Perfectly presented. I’m very grateful. Thank you\\n@jakecordelli6643 - I just got back into the gym and it feels amazing! I can’t believe I went so long without it.\\n@tulnaymijit3042 - I love every single episode you produce. Learn so much from each of  them. Is it possible to produce an episode that related to peri menopause,  menopause and hormonal changes, impact on overall  women health.\\n@susansrour3643 - Thank you so much for this episode! I’m curious… do you incorporate abs/core into any of the days?\\n@krupaltandel - I think I am going to tailor my perfect routing using this as:\\n1: Long Endurance\\n2: Leg Day\\n3: Heat/Cold Contrast (I don\\'t have access to sauna but I might just achieve something similar by switching the water temp in the shower)\\n@TheBond207 - Thanks Dr. Huberman for this wonderful episode, really helps set the right foundation for lifelong fitness! \\nOne request for subsequent episode - Please throw some light on common supplements used in endurance / resistance training like whey protein, BCAA , creatin and the likes and pros and cons of same if any.\\n@pratikmadrecha - Hey @hubermanlab, I don’t like the gym (indoors) and love outdoor workouts more. Mainly use ropes, resistance bands, dumbbells & body weight for exercising. I do like running and am trying to get into learning squash. What would you suggest as a weekly plan for someone like that?\\n@gigapaw3790 - Time for our weekly Lecture, Thank Andew for making mondays the most interesting days\\n@SparkleInMoonlight - This is such a great and practical quality video. Thank you for making them. Thanks to your videos we adopted certain changes in our daily regime and got really cool improvements\\n@SB-bn1dn - Thank you Andrew I will be signing up for your premium channel! This one the best podcast and what you do is inspiring \\n@RhinoJoeOutdoors - This is a great podcast! I just finished my first triathlon and I learned so much about my body. I strength train and my goal is fitness but I like the mental and physical challenge of endurance type events. I learned a lot from this podcast I will integrate into my training.\\n@qingyuhu - OMG, that 5 minutes of slow breathing is unbelievably effective! Mind blowing!\\n@abhimanyumishra6028 - Phenomenal podcast sir. A big fan of yours from Mumbai, India. Waiting for your podcast with Layne Norton. Also would really appreciate if we have a TRT specialist like Anabolic doctor or some one specializing in HRT/TRT for average Joe above 35-40 years. Podcast with Kyle Gillette was impeccable & highly informative. Can\\'t wait to see you grilling Greg Doucette. He\\'s a masterpiece too\\n@dariakoshkina3217 - I have been on this protocol for ~a month, and I\\'ve been trying to incorporate cardio for 2 months. I have improvements in HDL/LDL and triglycerides. Obviously can be other factors, but since adding cardio was the only significant change, I assume the protocol may help. Thanks! Having a straightforward plan helps.\\n', 3: '@godsentjesustosetusallfree9859 - They never explain that many people impacted with mental health problems is because of the ruthless system we live in. Too much stress causes a break down of the mind and body. They never let us take a step back from life and take things easy. This system needs to improve!\\n@concerned-nobodi - 33\\n', 4: '', 5: ''}, 'Video Link': {0: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufsIA5NARIo&pp=ygUPUGh5c2ljYWwgaGVhbHRo', 1: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MM5NwGbg7c&pp=ygUPUGh5c2ljYWwgaGVhbHRo', 2: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Ss8sTbFBY&pp=ygUPUGh5c2ljYWwgaGVhbHRo', 3: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnL028p41M8&pp=ygUPUGh5c2ljYWwgaGVhbHRo', 4: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phLE3ibA7Io&pp=ygUPUGh5c2ljYWwgaGVhbHRo', 5: 'https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0CHunCV-Y4I', 6: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K60xHx836T0&pp=ygUPUGh5c2ljYWwgaGVhbHRo'}}\n"
