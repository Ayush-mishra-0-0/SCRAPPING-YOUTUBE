Completely turned my life around. 2 months ago I started a simple workout routine after reading “Can’t hurt Me” by David Goggins. Your routine is one to aim for. The beautiful thing about the podcast is your choice of topics that are so beneficial to a guy like me. I had already read Dr Anna Lembke’s book, “Dopamine Nation” and consumed dozens of hours listening to Dr Jordan Peterson…and there you all are…top of the elite list of massively influential players driving me to be a better person spiritually, mentally, physically and emotionally.

This uses your soleus muscle which is designed to handle walking all day. Shown to cause over 50% improvements in glucose management after eating. \n",

Thanks for the program for the week, it is very well thought out.  The Stretching too, is a nice finishing touch to any workout. Thanks for all this info.  I had only 4 hours sleep last night, and I now will go out and workout anyways !  Mind you, Saturdays is upper body, so, no brainer.  :)\n",

You mentioned it in one episode so I'm sure it's on your radar but as a physical therapist acute/chronic pain is almost universally misunderstood and is a huge problem in our lives. I do a lot of education about it and I find it very interesting. I enjoy Adrian Louw's work, but I confess I have not looked heavily into the research for other suggestions.\n",

      "@marelizemaritz1398 - As a physiotherapist, I like to vary the types of exercises e.g. for legs I will do back squats, sumo squats, narrow squats, front squats etc. To keep challenging my muscle groups and also improving mobility in them. However, I understand if one's aim is to get muscle hypertrophy, sticking to those specific exercises that work for you, that's fine.\n",

      "@melissaenslin4 - Thank you, Dr Huberman. Your channel is a diamond in the sea of noise. I jump between extremes: either, don't do anything, or overtrain. This protocol is going to help me structure my training into something that can turn into a long term habits. So many training programs out there never seem to hit the sweet spot. They either are too difficult, too focused on one aspect of training, or just don't really do anything (if I never see donkey kicks again, I won't be sad).  I am working on ramping up fitness for a 2 week hiking expedition across Tanzania and Kilimanjaro. Will use this as a base, incorporate Wim Hoff breathing and obviously build up duration (and elevation) of my hikes closer I get to the expedition date.\n",

      "@GayatriTirumalasetty - Thanks for this Andrew, and for all the hard work. Could there be a part 2 of this 'optimal protocol', focusing on some possible modification in protocols or addition of new ones for female physiology? Perhaps keeping in mind female hormone cycle and how to leverage from different phases for better training? I'd really love for you to make content focusing on female physiology in particular. As I heard from Dr. Peter Attia's episode, where he made some strong statements on the lack of enough research on female health and as general public, we're not very informed about hormone regulation and leveraging it for our benefit. I hope this gets your attention. Thank you for initiating interest in science!\n",

I'm 59 years old, and obviously can't do the same level of workout you can...but I search for beginner leg workout, beginner HIIT.  I can find the template exercises at my own level.  But what helps me is to have an outline of how to get the whole body fit.  I really appreciate this!\n",

If I am not mistaken you have touched this subject briefly in the episode with Jeff Cavaliere. My belief is that developing and maintaining agility by practicing sports like basketball, volleyball, soccer, kickboxing, etc. is of high importance. This can count as your cardio workout, either mild or high intensity. I would love to hear your thoughts on how important (or unimportant) do you believe to be to work on your agility and what the best approach would be.\n",

If you want to get most of the benefits of speed, agility, power and flexibility, I'd advise you to sign up at your local or favorite boxing gym. I felt great the last three years training, and gave me all of the benefits of many types of workouts. It also builds a community, where you don't necessarily have to be beaten or be in sparrings.

It is also important to have strong hamstrings and good mobility in your hips/hamstrings prior to attempting sprinting.

I’m pretty fit — been active most of my adult life, but more recently began lifting heavy due to being post-menopausal and diagnosed with severe osteopenia.  I realize my perspective may be different due to my gender/build, but doing the same cardio bores me to tears.  I do walk three miles most evenings as a way to meet my 2,000 calorie a day goal and for general health, but for cardio (both zone 2 and HIIT), I simply have to mix it up.  I have a well-defined strength training routine, but I enjoy variety for my cardio and find so many YouTube fitness trainers who provide such fun resources.  Sometimes I do a little self-designed 30-minute routine done in 45 second work/15 second rest increments which cycle between various jumping and plank movements.  Even cranking up the music and dancing like crazy in my living room is enough to get my heart rate into Zone 2.  Typically, my cardio fluctuates between zones 2-5 with HIIT being higher.  I just wanted to encourage people that there are a variety of ways to exercise beyond cycling, running, rowing.\n",

Talking about the numbers of reps, sets, etc. he said that the muscle itself is not interested in 8 - 12 or 15 reps he's just reacting on specific hormone signals he gets. So he's doing high intensity training which means 120 seconds time under tension and muscle failure for each exercise ( which for him is one of the key parts of each exercise)    His workouts are containing not more than 5 exercise and he's training just 1 day a week! Because on his opinion the body needs a whole lot more time than the casual 48 hours to supercompensate  the strength level. He recommends not even doing any hard cardio.

Probably the protocol is responsible but also I have trained for few years total in the past (never used drugs) so muscle memory might play a role. But the key here is holding very strict diet (for me that's about 2800kcal of whole foods, containing around 130-150g of protein for my body mass of 75kg). Secondary to above is being able to judge based on how I feel, how to maybe replace some compound exercises on some days with smaller or lighter movements or skipping particular exercise completely if I feel very sore in some muscle group which allows decent recovery management.\n",

      "@hejiranyc - I'm 53 and I have been consistently weight training for over 30 years.  One thing I have learned the hard way is that weight machines are awful for your joints, specifically the knees.  I used to train my legs using an incline leg press and single-knee squats using a Smith machine.  Starting in my late 30s/early 40s, my knees started to fail.  It got to the point where I could not use stairs without wincing in pain.  I thought I would need to get my knees replaced.  By necessity, I had to stop and switch to free squats with a barbell.  Not only did I see better results in terms of strength and conditioning, my knee pain has pretty much disappeared.   My theory is that machines force the body to follow a single, unnatural plane of movement, whereas free squats are not linear and adapt to micro-balancing movements that coordinate the back and legs in a natural way.\n",

I am a 50 y.o. woman athlete who is in the gym 5x a week which includes mostly strength training. I also do yoga and some cardio.  I just learned that I have osteoarthritis in my back and hip.  I have done a little research on my own in terms of what supplements would help and ways to help the pain and maintain strength. For example, does Glucosamine really help? So much conflicting information out there.  I would LOVE it if you would do an episode on arthritis/joint pain as so many athletes experience this but don't talk much about it. I am really struggling with this new information of having this disease.... and to be honest, aging. I am young at heart and love to move my body.

But given all my input I have pov on why this protocol works for our awesome host (whomst we stan). Splitting up all the resistance training into the muscle groups in isolation works for a neuro proff celeb because he really enjoys managing the details and probably gets some mental rewards for doing so. Also, his position in life allows more time for fitness than a lot of people can prioritize. Given this, I suggest people for whomst (that's 2 in one comment!) this protocol might be a struggle, consider resistance training with compound movements instead. Squats and deadlifts are your best friends if your time is limited. Yes, you have to be careful on the weight, but it takes a whole lot less time because it works a bunch of muscles at once. If you're like me and work a time-demanding job with family commitments on top, the question isn't \"what's the best foundation for a workout?\", It's \"What can I get done in 40 minutes 2-3x/week?\". And the answers to those Qs are very different.\n",

If I could measure what my current recovery rate is I could plan around that and ensure incremental gains over time w/o injuries.\n",

Then from there, I started to go back down in the reversed order.

Leg Extension and leg curls are more finishing movements for perhaps bodybuilders or a rehab setting.  I understand the risk of injury but that diminishes provided your not using heavy weight (4-8 range).  I don't see any benefit to doing leg extensions in the low rep range.  Most people avoid squats and deadlifts because they're a lot harder than sitting on a leg extension machine. With regards to your calf work, is it even necessary if you are running and were to do compound lower body movements?  This isn't a bad program but I wouldn't consider it optimal especially for a well trained person regardless of age/sex.  The lower body workouts do not appear very challenging as they are composed of probably the least effective muscle building movements.  Why not 3 full body sessions (20-25 sets total (8-20 rep range) with half devoted to lower body) composed of compound movements.  Unless you are stepping on a bodybuilding stage, direct calf work isn't needed.  With regards to the cardio, how about just 3 -  60-75 minutes session with 30-35 in Zone 2 (spin bike, bike erg, treadmill, run), and the rest in Zone 3-5 (Assault bike, rower, ski erg, burpees).\n",

She's a controller and I'm a victim (mainly due to chronic burnout) as I rebuilt my body and became less burnt out I think it started to peal back the co dependent layers. Giving us the courage to sit down and talk about our relationship realistically.

Hands down, one of the biggest most important things a care provider of any variety can do to truly become a healer is to adopt the \"novel concept\" of the mind being influential in a big way on the physical health of a person. There are more connections than can be arbitrarily shrugged off and listening to Dr Mike on here acknowledging and promoting the holistic approach is encouraging.  Not every illness has a psychological genesis but a great deal of them do.  I'm definitely going to watch part 2 (now, if there is one already!)...\n",

I recently had to switch insurance plans, and my present psychiatrist is not on the plan; so I will pay out of pocket. I could barely afford it, but the reason why I'm doing things this way is because I've had a lot of bad experiences with different psychiatrists in the past; including a nurse practitioner who told me \"there's nothing I can do for you.\"! I also searched for psychiatrists before, and none seem to want to take my Medicare plan/Medicaid. My present psychiatrist is the only one who seems to genuinely care about my hard to treat bipolar, depression, anxiety, and ADHD. We  have gone through a lot of ups and downs; but he never told me \"I can't do anything for you\"; and eventually helped lead me to pretty good stability now. He is good to listen and has a good bedside manner; and is very knowledgeable about psychiatric illnesses and pharmaceuticals. I have not found that yet anywhere else. Not one yet!\n",

It is getting better; but I still think the \"Western World\" almost leaves out the head of the body (I do not know why) because for some reason a lot of insurance companies do not cover mental health services as well as the other physical services (as well as vision, hearing, and dental!). All of the Body is intricate and very much connected, so I don't understand why these aspects of health are covered less or not covered at all. I know this may be a tangent from your discussion, Dr. MIke, but I admired your video about the interaction between physical medicine and psychichiatry. It reminded me of that one is just as important as the other in medical practice. That makes a lot of sense, Dr. Mike. Thank you for your wonderful, inspiring video!\n",

They'd rather base the diagnosis on what they see on paper or what they see in person : than actually looking at everything to rule out anything that's serious or get down to the real genuine diagnosis.  A lot of people now work to be paid, not because they want to help people. I've been in an out of hospitals and doctors since I was a baby to now. Still go regularly. I'm 24. So many are leaving or if they stay they see everything as monetary (more patients equals more pay) rather than actually being interested or wanting to help people feel comfortable or get better. Drugs are also a lottery: people who don't need it, get more whereas those who need it don't get it or get lower dose than others do. Mental health in the UK is terrible. There's numbers to call, get given meds or you go to CBT: that's it. I try and handle my mental health on my own by doing things I enjoy and talk to people I can trust.

I started a journey similar to his about a year ago when I had a relationship that meant very much to me end. I started working on an idea I have for a book around this topic, and I cried like I've been trying to do for almost a year. I'm finally starting to be able to grieve some of the things I feel like I lost in my life, or be able to go far deeper in my healing.

I am so impressed with how both of you have used therapy in your lives. I have not practiced therapy for awhile because I think the current system is a mess. Please have a podcast addressing this and also trying to help people understand how therapy should be able to help them if the system worked better. Relationships are healing. Tools learned in therapy are healing. It isn’t perfect and it is a process. When I started graduate school in the 1980’s, most insurance paid 50% for unlimited sessions. Financial barriers now exist but so do barriers of resistance and shame. If more people understood and if somehow therapy was recognized as important to health and wellness and part of disease prevention ….maybe I can regain my faith in the system and even come back to help.\n",

I hope to make the kind of self-growth that he clearly has. As a quick side-note and suggestion for a future podcast, I would love a video (or perhaps a series?) on strategies for new parents to enhance their ability to adapt to the challenges of early infant care (e.g., frequent night awakenings; chronic sleep deficits) and ways to quickly promote \"homeostasis\" in the home environment again (e.g., helping the infant sleep through the night as early as possible). For example, I would love to know what the literature says about morning sunlight viewing with infants and the effects it has on the infant's circadian rhythm. I know my infant daughter of 6 weeks typically won't open her eyes when we go \"praise the sun\" in the morning together, and I wonder if that might be because her eyes are just too sensitive to the brightness. Give it some thought, as I'm sure it would be enormously helpful for many new and expecting parents out there (including myself). Thanks for the excellent episode, Andrew!\n",

I really respect Peter's self disclosure on his personal mental health journey.  It certainly resonated with me and things that I still struggle even though I worked as a Therapist for several years.  As a Woman, there is nothing I like more than a Man who is very candid, genuine, and present \"in the moment\".  Both of you Gentlemen are stellar examples of just that.

Especially now in my late 50s I see around me the direction my peers are moving towards and I want a different older age to the one they are accepting.  One thing that struck me from this latest episode is the courage you both shown in facing your personal emotional demons and your willingness to look into the root for these manifestations.  I would like to do the same but not sure I have the inner strength to try it but certainly listening to you has given me food for thoughts.  I was also surprised when I heard that you both see a therapist on a regular basis.  As a child growing up in the 70s and 80s Britain, therapies/counseling always elicit a sense of self-indulgence which only Americans embrace. Maybe I need to rethink that too.  I do however feel we are very blessed to have the opportunity to consider all these new life sciences and the freedom to pick and choose which ones to incorporate in our lives.\n",

I know when and when not to take icebaths, I know how to study more efficiently, how to recover better, and how to eat to perform optimally. The missing piece for me is where being a women falls into all of this. I can feel differences in training and cognition based on where I am in my cycle. The literature I have read on the female hormonal cycle and athletic performance has been conflicting or mostly about menopause. There's so much research on hormones and fertility. We assume that losing our cycle means we are overtraining or unhealthy because we aren't fertile. Is it conceivable that with intense exercise women temporarily lose their cycle because it isn't an optimal time to get pregnant, but not necessarily an unhealthy state to be in? I just feel like so much of the literature on female hormones focuses on fertility. How much do we know about this? I would be so interested in a podcast that looked at female hormones and performance. I loved the podcast with Dr. Gottfried, but I feel like I was left with more questions than when I started. Yes female hormones can and should be optimized, but what does living and training in accordance with hormonal shifts look like for someone who already has a healthy cycle?\n",

It is impressive for scientists to finally be open to talking about this.  The ‘feeling’ states of being are truly esoteric, mystical, immeasurable and transcendent sorts of experiences.  As human beings, we all can accurately recognize their presence or absence when we have or lack authentic connection, safety and the ability to be vulnerable and ‘seen’ by those that we love.   Self-hatred is an astonishingly common human experience as well.  Especially with people that have had complex trauma beginning childhood.  This kind of trauma leads to a myriad of defense/coping mechanisms that are adaptive in childhood but inhibitive to pure connection, happiness and growth as we age.  And they are prohibitive to evolution as well.  By sharing what you have in such an open and vulnerable manner, it gives me hope that more and more people on this planet can heal!

No one in their right mind would be a disturbance while sharing a small space and especially after having an issue with something they don't like.
